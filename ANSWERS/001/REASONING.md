# Case 001: how the decision was reached

63. State `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING` (by `incoming-ask`).
64. Rule `do-ask` fired: state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING).
65. Called `ask_system` (attempt 1, key 001:do-ask:17).

## What the agent said

> I've asked the incoming-payments system about the £750 hold and the £2,600 payment from L Farrell. Its answer isn't in the case yet, so I can't tell you why the hold was placed or when it will be released.
> 
> I'm not releasing the hold. That isn't something I can do from here. Once the answer is in, I'll explain the reason for the hold and what happens next. That should cover whether anything can be done before your rent is due tomorrow.
