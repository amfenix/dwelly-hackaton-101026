# Case banking-001-at-01: Was the one-off transfer sent?

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

The customer asked whether Harrow & Vale sent the £420 one-off transfer to Alder & Reed Workshop, which shows as a debit on their account. The desk classed it as a question about a transfer and put it to the payment system, and the request went through. No answer has come back yet, so whether the payment was sent is still unconfirmed; the only evidence so far is the debit in the account activity, with no confirmation found.

## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: payment, about: transfer, amount: 420.00), by rule `do-ask`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `payment-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = payment → true (args.system=payment)
  - next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=payment)
  - payment_asked absent → true (payment_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)

Facts established:

- subject: **transfer**
- amount: **420.00**

- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **False**
- request_type: **question**
- next_system: **payment**
- credentials_requested: **False**
- joint_holder_change: **False**

- event 1 (Harrow & Vale Bank plc): One-off transfer to Alder & Reed Workshop: debit shown in your account activity. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]
