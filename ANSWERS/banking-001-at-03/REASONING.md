72. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Customer Mara Ellison (unverified, secure chat) asks whether the £420 one-off transfer to Alder & Reed Workshop was sent by H&V; she can see the debit. The payment system check was refused because the case is in WAITING state, not TRIAGED, so transfer status could not be read. Please verify the customer and check the transfer status."}.
73. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).

## What the agent said

> I couldn't check whether the £420 payment to Alder & Reed Workshop was sent, and the case is still open and waiting.
> 
> - **Payment check:** the payment system refused my request because the case is in the WAITING state. It only accepts the check once the case is TRIAGED.
> - **Escalation:** I then tried to hand the case to a person, and that was refused for the same reason.
> 
> Mara Ellison is also not yet verified, which may be what is holding the case in WAITING. Someone needs to verify her, and the case then needs to be triaged so the payment status can be read. I haven't told the customer anything about the payment, because no record shows whether it was sent.
