64. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Customer Mara Ellison (not verified, secure chat) asks whether H&V sent her £420 one-off transfer to Alder & Reed Workshop; a debit shows in her activity. The payment system was already queried (payment_asked=True) but no payment_status is in the case, and the confirmation field is 'none'. Both a repeat payment query and a reply were refused because the case is in WAITING. Please check the transfer status in the payment records and answer her. Also complete identity verification before sharing any account detail."}.
65. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).
