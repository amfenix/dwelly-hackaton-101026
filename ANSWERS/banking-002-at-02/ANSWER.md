# Case banking-002-at-02: Expected Incoming Payment

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Elowen Marsh, an unverified customer writing over secure chat, asked the desk to check whether H&V had received a transfer for a pottery studio kiln contribution that wasn't showing in her account. The desk classified this as a question about an incoming payment and asked the incoming-payments system about it, which closed the case in the asked state. The desk's attempt to send a reply was refused, so no answer has gone to her yet, and the record does not show what the incoming system returned.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-07-21T09:00:00Z · External message — Sender → Elowen Marsh

> I’ve sent the contribution for the kiln by bank transfer.

2. 2025-07-21T09:47:00Z · Secure chat — Elowen Marsh → H&V service agent

> I’m escalating this because the contribution for our pottery studio kiln still isn’t showing in my account. The sender told me they transferred it, so please check whether H&V has received it.

  - args.system = incoming → true (args.system=incoming)
  - next_system = incoming → true (next_system=incoming)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=incoming)
  - incoming_asked absent → true (incoming_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
