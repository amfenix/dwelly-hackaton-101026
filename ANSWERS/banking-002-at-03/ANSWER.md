# Case banking-002-at-03: Expected Incoming Payment

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Elowen Marsh, an unverified customer on secure chat, asked whether H&V had received a transfer for her pottery studio's kiln contribution. The desk queried the incoming-payment records, but no answer had come back, so the case closed as "wait" and nothing was confirmed or sent to her. The agent's later attempts to reply, ask the system again and escalate were all refused because the case was already in the waiting state, so the incoming result is still outstanding and no person has been assigned.

The request:

> I’m expecting a contribution toward the cost of a shared pottery studio kiln. The sender told me by phone that they had transferred it, but I can’t see it in my H&V account; please check whether it has arrived.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-07-21T09:00:00Z · External message — Sender → Elowen Marsh

> I’ve sent the contribution for the kiln by bank transfer.

2. 2025-07-21T09:47:00Z · Secure chat — Elowen Marsh → H&V service agent

> I’m escalating this because the contribution for our pottery studio kiln still isn’t showing in my account. The sender told me they transferred it, so please check whether H&V has received it.

3. 2025-07-21T10:34:00Z · Internal note — H&V service agent → H&V incoming-payment journal

> I’m checking incoming credits recorded for Elowen Marsh’s account now. I’ll report only what H&V’s records show.
