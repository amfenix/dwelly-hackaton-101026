# Case banking-002-at-03: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Elowen Marsh): I’m escalating this because the contribution for our pottery studio kiln still isn’t showing in my account. The sender told me they transferred it, so please check whether H&V has received it. [facts: requester='Elowen Marsh', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Elowen Marsh", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Elowen Marsh (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → secure_chat (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → False (by `read-requester`).
10. Rule `read-subject` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
11. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-subject:2).

16. Rule `read-incoming` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
17. Called `check_incoming` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-incoming:4).
18. Note from `read-incoming`: event 3 (H&V incoming-payment journal): I’m checking incoming credits recorded for Elowen Marsh’s account now. I’ll report only what H&V’s records show. [facts: incoming_asked=True]
19. `check_incoming` found {"incoming_asked": true}.
20. `incoming_asked`: not known → True (by `read-incoming`).

42. Rule `read-confirmation` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
43. Called `check_confirmation` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-confirmation:12).
44. Note from `read-confirmation`: event 2 (Elowen Marsh): I’m escalating this because the contribution for our pottery studio kiln still isn’t showing in my account. The sender told me they transferred it, so please check whether H&V has received it. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]
45. `check_confirmation` found {"confirmation": "none", "instructed_outside_portal": false}.

50. Classifier (jev jev-latest) on `subject`: incoming_payment, confidence 1.00 → incoming_payment.
51. `request_type`: not known → question (by `triage`).
52. `subject`: not known → incoming_payment (by `triage`).
53. State `READING` → `TRIAGED` (by `triage`).

55. `next_system`: not known → incoming (by `asked-incoming`).
56. Rule `incoming-waits` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system = incoming → true (next_system=incoming); incoming_asked → true (incoming_asked=True); incoming_found absent → true (incoming_found=not known). The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
57. State `TRIAGED` → `WAITING` (by `incoming-waits`).
58. The case closed in `WAITING`: **wait**.
59. The agent asked for `reply` {}.
60. Refused `reply` in `WAITING`: registration-reply: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); registration_asked is not known (registration_asked=not known); registered present is false (registered=not known); payment-reply: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = payment is false (next_system=incoming); payment_status present is false (payment_status=not known); incoming-reply: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); incoming_found present is false (incoming_found=not known); recurring-reply: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = recurring is false (next_system=incoming); recurring_status present is false (recurring_status=not known); card-reply: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = card is false (next_system=incoming); card_status present is false (card_status=not known); access-reply: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = access is false (next_system=incoming); access_status present is false (access_status=not known); business-reply: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = business is false (next_system=incoming); business_status present is false (business_status=not known); documents-reply: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = documents is false (next_system=incoming); document_ready present is false (document_ready=not known); tariff-reply: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = tariff is false (next_system=incoming); tariff_status present is false (tariff_status=not known).
61. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "incoming"}.
62. Refused `ask_system` in `WAITING`: payment-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = payment is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = payment is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); incoming-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); incoming_asked absent is false (incoming_asked=True); recurring-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = recurring is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = recurring is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); card-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = card is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = card is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); access-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = access is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = access is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); business-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = business is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = business is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); documents-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = documents is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = documents is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); tariff-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = tariff is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = tariff is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming).
63. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Customer Elowen Marsh (unverified, secure chat) asks whether a kiln contribution sent by a third party has arrived. The incoming system was already queried (incoming_asked=True) but there is no confirmation and no incoming_found result. The case is stuck in WAITING (not TRIAGED), so both reply and a repeat ask_system were refused. A person needs to check incoming records, verify the customer's identity, and answer without claiming a receipt the records don't show."}.
64. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).
