# Case banking-002-at-03: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Elowen Marsh): I’m escalating this because the contribution for our pottery studio kiln still isn’t showing in my account. The sender told me they transferred it, so please check whether H&V has received it. [facts: requester='Elowen Marsh', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Elowen Marsh", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Elowen Marsh (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → secure_chat (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → False (by `read-requester`).
10. Rule `read-subject` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
11. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-subject:2).
12. `find_subject` found {}.
13. Rule `read-payment` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
14. Called `check_payment` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-payment:3).

16. Rule `read-incoming` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
17. Called `check_incoming` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-incoming:4).
18. Note from `read-incoming`: event 3 (H&V incoming-payment journal): I’m checking incoming credits recorded for Elowen Marsh’s account now. I’ll report only what H&V’s records show. [facts: incoming_asked=True]
19. `check_incoming` found {"incoming_asked": true}.
20. `incoming_asked`: not known → True (by `read-incoming`).
21. Rule `read-recurring` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).

27. Rule `read-access` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).

32. `check_business` found {}.
33. Rule `read-documents` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).

35. `check_documents` found {}.
36. Rule `read-registration` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
37. Called `check_registration` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-registration:10).
38. `check_registration` found {}.
39. Rule `read-confirmation` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
40. Called `check_confirmation` (attempt 1, key banking-002-at-03:read-confirmation:11).
41. Note from `read-confirmation`: event 2 (Elowen Marsh): I’m escalating this because the contribution for our pottery studio kiln still isn’t showing in my account. The sender told me they transferred it, so please check whether H&V has received it. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]
42. `check_confirmation` found {"confirmation": "none", "instructed_outside_portal": false}.
43. `confirmation`: not known → none (by `read-confirmation`).
44. `instructed_outside_portal`: not known → False (by `read-confirmation`).
45. Rule `triage` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
46. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `request_type`: status → status.
47. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `subject`: incoming_payment → incoming_payment.
48. `request_type`: not known → status (by `triage`).
49. `subject`: not known → incoming_payment (by `triage`).
50. State `READING` → `TRIAGED` (by `triage`).
51. Rule `asked-incoming` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system absent → true (next_system=not known); incoming_asked → true (incoming_asked=True).
52. `next_system`: not known → incoming (by `asked-incoming`).
53. Rule `incoming-waits` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system = incoming → true (next_system=incoming); incoming_asked → true (incoming_asked=True); incoming_found absent → true (incoming_found=not known). The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
54. State `TRIAGED` → `WAITING` (by `incoming-waits`).
55. The case closed in `WAITING`: **wait**.

## What the agent said

> I've already asked the incoming-payments system whether the kiln contribution has arrived. Its answer isn't in the case yet, so the case stays in a waiting state. I'm not taking any other step until that answer comes back.
