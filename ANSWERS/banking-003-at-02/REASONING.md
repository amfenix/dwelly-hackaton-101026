# Case banking-003-at-02: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-02:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Elise Rowan): I’m escalating this because the instruction still has no sent confirmation. Please check its current stage and tell me whether I need to authorise it. [facts: requester='Elise Rowan', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Elise Rowan", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Elise Rowan (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → secure_chat (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → False (by `read-requester`).
10. Rule `read-subject` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
11. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-02:read-subject:2).
12. `find_subject` found {}.
13. Rule `read-payment` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).

18. `check_incoming` found {}.
19. Rule `read-recurring` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).

31. Rule `read-documents` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
32. Called `check_documents` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-02:read-documents:9).
33. `check_documents` found {}.
34. Rule `read-registration` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
35. Called `check_registration` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-02:read-registration:10).
36. `check_registration` found {}.
37. Rule `read-confirmation` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
38. Called `check_confirmation` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-02:read-confirmation:11).
39. Note from `read-confirmation`: event 2 (Elise Rowan): I’m escalating this because the instruction still has no sent confirmation. Please check its current stage and tell me whether I need to authorise it. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]
40. `check_confirmation` found {"confirmation": "none", "instructed_outside_portal": false}.
41. `confirmation`: not known → none (by `read-confirmation`).
42. `instructed_outside_portal`: not known → False (by `read-confirmation`).
43. Rule `triage` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
44. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `request_type`: status → status.
45. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `subject`: transfer → transfer.
46. `request_type`: not known → status (by `triage`).
47. `subject`: not known → transfer (by `triage`).
48. State `READING` → `TRIAGED` (by `triage`).
49. Rule `route-payment` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system absent → true (next_system=not known); subject in [transfer, batch, payment_package] → true (subject=transfer).
50. `next_system`: not known → payment (by `route-payment`).
51. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "payment"}.
52. Rule `payment-ask` (on `ask_system`) fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); args.system = payment → true (args.system=payment); next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment); next_system absent → false (next_system=payment); payment_asked absent → true (payment_asked=not known); request_type not in [register, change, instruction, authority] → true (request_type=status).
53. State `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING` (by `payment-ask`).
54. Rule `do-ask` fired: state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING).
55. Called `ask_system` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-02:do-ask:15).
56. Action in the world: `ask_system` {"system": "payment", "about": "transfer"}.
57. `ask_system` found {}.
58. State `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED` (by `do-ask`).
59. The case closed in `ASKED`: **ask_system**.
