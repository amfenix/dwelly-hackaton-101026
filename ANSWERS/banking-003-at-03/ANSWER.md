## What the system received

- Source role: Bank customer
- Bank: Harrow & Vale Bank plc (fictional)
- Created: 2025-07-23 09:00:00 UTC

The request:

> I saved a transfer instruction for an invoice in my secure portal, but there is no sent confirmation. Please check whether it has been submitted and tell me what stage it is at.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-07-23T09:00:00Z · Secure portal — Elise Rowan → Harrow & Vale Bank plc

> I created and saved a transfer instruction for an invoice in my secure portal. I have not seen a confirmation that it was sent.

2. 2025-07-23T09:47:00Z · Secure chat — Elise Rowan → H&V service agent

> I’m escalating this because the instruction still has no sent confirmation. Please check its current stage and tell me whether I need to authorise it.

3. 2025-07-23T10:34:00Z · Internal note — H&V service agent → H&V instruction journal

> I’m checking the instruction stage against the identifier in Elise’s secure session. I will not authorise the payment on her behalf.

Attachments: none.

  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment)
  - payment_asked → true (payment_asked=True)
  - payment_status absent → true (payment_status=not known)
