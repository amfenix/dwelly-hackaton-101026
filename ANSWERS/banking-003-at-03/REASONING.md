# Case banking-003-at-03: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Elise Rowan): I’m escalating this because the instruction still has no sent confirmation. Please check its current stage and tell me whether I need to authorise it. [facts: requester='Elise Rowan', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Elise Rowan", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Elise Rowan (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → secure_chat (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → False (by `read-requester`).
10. Rule `read-subject` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
11. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-subject:2).
12. `find_subject` found {}.
13. Rule `read-payment` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
14. Called `check_payment` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-payment:3).
15. Note from `read-payment`: event 3 (H&V instruction journal): I’m checking the instruction stage against the identifier in Elise’s secure session. I will not authorise the payment on her behalf. [facts: payment_asked=True]
16. `check_payment` found {"payment_asked": true}.
17. `payment_asked`: not known → True (by `read-payment`).
18. Rule `read-incoming` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
19. Called `check_incoming` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-incoming:4).
20. `check_incoming` found {}.
21. Rule `read-recurring` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
22. Called `check_recurring` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-recurring:5).
23. `check_recurring` found {}.
24. Rule `read-card` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
25. Called `check_card` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-card:6).
26. `check_card` found {}.
27. Rule `read-access` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
28. Called `check_access` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-access:7).
29. `check_access` found {}.
30. Rule `read-business` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
31. Called `check_business` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-business:8).
32. `check_business` found {}.
33. Rule `read-documents` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
34. Called `check_documents` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-documents:9).
35. `check_documents` found {}.
36. Rule `read-registration` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
37. Called `check_registration` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-registration:10).
38. `check_registration` found {}.
39. Rule `read-confirmation` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
40. Called `check_confirmation` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-03:read-confirmation:11).
41. Note from `read-confirmation`: event 2 (Elise Rowan): I’m escalating this because the instruction still has no sent confirmation. Please check its current stage and tell me whether I need to authorise it. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]
42. `check_confirmation` found {"confirmation": "none", "instructed_outside_portal": false}.
43. `confirmation`: not known → none (by `read-confirmation`).
44. `instructed_outside_portal`: not known → False (by `read-confirmation`).
45. Rule `triage` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
46. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `request_type`: status → status.
47. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `subject`: transfer → transfer.
48. `request_type`: not known → status (by `triage`).
49. `subject`: not known → transfer (by `triage`).
50. State `READING` → `TRIAGED` (by `triage`).
51. Rule `asked-payment` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system absent → true (next_system=not known); payment_asked → true (payment_asked=True).
52. `next_system`: not known → payment (by `asked-payment`).
53. Rule `payment-waits` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment); payment_asked → true (payment_asked=True); payment_status absent → true (payment_status=not known). The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
54. State `TRIAGED` → `WAITING` (by `payment-waits`).
55. The case closed in `WAITING`: **wait**.
56. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "payment"}.
57. Refused `ask_system` in `WAITING`: payment-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system absent is false (next_system=payment); payment_asked absent is false (payment_asked=True); incoming-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = incoming is false (args.system=payment); next_system = incoming is false (next_system=payment); next_system absent is false (next_system=payment); recurring-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = recurring is false (args.system=payment); next_system = recurring is false (next_system=payment); next_system absent is false (next_system=payment); card-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = card is false (args.system=payment); next_system = card is false (next_system=payment); next_system absent is false (next_system=payment); access-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = access is false (args.system=payment); next_system = access is false (next_system=payment); next_system absent is false (next_system=payment); business-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = business is false (args.system=payment); next_system = business is false (next_system=payment); next_system absent is false (next_system=payment); documents-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = documents is false (args.system=payment); next_system = documents is false (next_system=payment); next_system absent is false (next_system=payment).
58. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Elise Rowan (unverified, secure chat) asks whether a saved invoice transfer instruction from the secure portal has been submitted, what stage it is at, and whether she must authorise it. No sent confirmation exists and it was not instructed outside the portal. The payment system was flagged as asked, but no answer is in the case. A repeat payment ask was refused because the case is in WAITING, not TRIAGED. Please verify her identity, check the instruction's stage in the payment records, and tell her whether authorisation is needed."}.
59. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).

## What the agent said

> I couldn't find out where Elise Rowan's transfer instruction is, so I haven't answered her. The case is stuck in a waiting state, and I'm stopping here.
> 
> - **Payment check:** The payment system was marked as already asked, but no answer is in the case. When I tried to ask it again, the desk refused. It only accepts that request when the case is in the triaged state, and this one is waiting.
> - **Escalation:** The desk refused this too, for the same reason.
> - **Case status:** The case is marked final with the outcome "wait". Nothing further can be done from here, so it stays open for a person to pick up.
> - **Verification:** Elise is not verified. Someone needs to confirm her identity before any details about her payment go back to her.
> 
> What the case does show is that she has no sent confirmation and didn't give the instruction outside the portal. It doesn't show the stage of her instruction or whether she needs to authorise it, so I have nothing to tell her on either point.
