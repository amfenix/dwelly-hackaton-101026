# Case banking-003-at-04: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-003-at-04:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Elise Rowan): I’m escalating this because the instruction still has no sent confirmation. Please check its current stage and tell me whether I need to authorise it. [facts: requester='Elise Rowan', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Elise Rowan", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Elise Rowan (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → secure_chat (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → False (by `read-requester`).

16. Note from `read-payment`: event 4 (H&V instruction journal): “Awaiting authorisation” [facts: payment_status='AWAITING_AUTHORISATION']
17. `check_payment` found {"payment_asked": true, "payment_status": "AWAITING_AUTHORISATION"}.

## What the agent said

> I've sent the reply. The payment system shows the instruction as awaiting authorisation, so it hasn't been sent yet, which explains the missing confirmation. The reply tells Elise this, and that it won't go out until it is authorised.
> 
> I didn't ask the payment system again, because the case already held its answer. The requester isn't verified, so the reply is limited to what the record shows.
