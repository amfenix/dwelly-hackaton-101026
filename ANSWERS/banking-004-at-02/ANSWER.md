## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: payment, about: transfer), by rule `do-ask`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `payment-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = payment → true (args.system=payment)
  - next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=payment)
  - payment_asked absent → true (payment_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
