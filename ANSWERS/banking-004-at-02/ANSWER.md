# Case banking-004-at-02: Why the transfer was declined

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellery, a verified customer writing through the secure portal, asked why her 14 July 2025 transfer to Northmere Housing Co-operative was not completed, since the portal shows the status but no reason. The desk classified this as a question about a transfer and sent a query about it to the payment system, and the case closed at that step. The record contains no reason for the failure and no reply from the payment system, so the explanation she asked for is still outstanding.

## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: payment, about: transfer), by rule `do-ask`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `payment-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = payment → true (args.system=payment)
  - next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=payment)
  - payment_asked absent → true (payment_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
