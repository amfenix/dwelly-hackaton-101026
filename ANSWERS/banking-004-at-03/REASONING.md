## What the agent said

> I haven't been able to find out why the transfer to Northmere Housing Co-operative on 14 July 2025 wasn't completed. The case is in a final WAITING state, so the desk refused my request to check the payment system. The refusal said the case isn't in the TRIAGED state the lookup needs.
> 
> The customer's identity is verified and the request is a plain question about a payment. No payment record has been read yet, so I can't give a reason without guessing. I've stopped here. The case stays open and goes to a person to review.
