71. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Verified customer Mara Ellery asks why her 14 July 2025 transfer to Northmere Housing Co-operative shows as not completed in the secure portal. The payment system check was refused because the case is in state WAITING, not TRIAGED, so the payment record has not been read. The reason for the failure is not yet known. Please check the payment record and explain the reason to the customer."}.
72. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).

## What the agent said

> The state is WAITING. I'll check the case status.
> I couldn't get an answer for the customer, and the case is still open. It is in a WAITING state, and the desk has closed it as "wait".
> 
> - **Payment check refused:** I asked the payment system why the 14 July transfer to Northmere Housing Co-operative wasn't completed. The desk refused because the case has to be in TRIAGED state, and this one is in WAITING. So the payment record hasn't been read, and the reason for the failure is unknown.
> - **Escalation refused:** I tried to hand the case to a person with a note, and that was refused for the same reason.
> 
> Nothing else is available to me from here. Mara Ellery is verified and has not yet been told why the transfer failed. Someone needs to move the case out of WAITING, or check the payment record directly, so she can get an answer.
