## What the agent said

> I used the reply tool, and the desk accepted it. The case is now closed as replied.
> 
> The records already held the answer, so I didn't query the payment system again. The 14 July 2025 transfer to Northmere Housing Co-operative shows as DECLINED. The recorded reason is "The receiving bank declined the transfer." The records give no further detail, so the reply doesn't go beyond that.
> 
> I didn't read the reply text the desk wrote, so I can't confirm its exact wording.
