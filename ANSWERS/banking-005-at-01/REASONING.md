## What the agent said

> The records can't be queried for this kind of request, so the next step is to register the return request with the team that handles it.
> I've registered your request to seek the return of the £286.40 transfer that went to the wrong saved recipient. It's now with the team that handles returns, and the case is closed on my side.
> 
> I couldn't check the payment records first, because the desk wouldn't run that lookup for a registration request. I haven't confirmed the payment or the recipient from the bank's records, so the team will need to do that.
