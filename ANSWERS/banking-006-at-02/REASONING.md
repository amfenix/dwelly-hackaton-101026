## What the agent said

> I've asked the payment system to look up the two North Quay Utilities transfers for £84.20. The case is now closed at this step.
> 
> The payment system hasn't returned anything yet. So I can't say whether the two entries are one instruction shown twice or two separate instructions. I also can't say whether the pending one has been stopped or returned.
> 
> Mira's identity is also still unverified on this chat. Before the bank stops or returns anything, she will need to be verified and give a clear instruction.
