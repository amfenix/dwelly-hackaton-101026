# Case banking-006-at-03: Two Similar Transfers

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Mira Ellison, writing over secure chat as an account owner whose identity is not verified, asked the desk to check whether her transfer instructions were separate and whether the pending one had been stopped or returned. The desk classified this as a transfer request, put the question to the payment system, and closed the case as waiting because that system's answer has not come back. A second ask to the payment system was refused because the case was already waiting, and nothing was stopped, cancelled or returned. What is left is the payment system's answer on whether there are one or two instructions and whether the pending one can be stopped, along with Mira's unverified identity.

## What the system received

- Source role: Bank customer
- Bank: Harrow & Vale Bank plc (fictional)
- Created: 2025-07-29 09:00:00 UTC

The request:

> Mira, the account holder, wants H&V to establish whether two similar outgoing transfer entries are one instruction shown twice or two separate instructions, and asks whether the second can be stopped or returned.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-07-29T09:00:00Z · Secure portal — H&V → Mira Ellison

> Your payment activity shows two similar outgoing transfer entries to North Quay Utilities for £84.20. One is marked Completed and the other Pending.

2. 2025-07-29T09:47:00Z · Secure chat — Mira Ellison → H&V agent

> I own this account and only meant to make one transfer. Please check whether these are separate instructions, and whether the pending one has been stopped or returned.

3. 2025-07-29T10:34:00Z · Internal note — H&V agent → H&V payment instruction journal

> I’m checking the count and independent instruction references for Mira’s own payment instructions before advising. I have not cancelled or returned either instruction.

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `WAITING`: rule `payment-waits` — The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment)
  - payment_asked → true (payment_asked=True)
  - payment_status absent → true (payment_status=not known)

Facts established:

- requester: **Mira Ellison**
- role: **customer**
- channel: **secure_chat**

- subject: **transfer**
- payment_asked: **True**
- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **False**
- request_type: **register**
- next_system: **payment**
