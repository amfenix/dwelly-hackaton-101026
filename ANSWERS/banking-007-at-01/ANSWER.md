# Case banking-007-at-01: International Transfer Status

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

The customer asked a question about an international transfer. The desk classified it as a transfer question, routed it to the payment system and asked that system about the transfer, which closed the case. The reply to the customer said H&V has recorded the transfer as sent, that nothing shows the beneficiary has received it, and that no further status came back, so the desk can't confirm arrival. The record lists nothing left for a person to do.

  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = payment → true (args.system=payment)
  - next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=payment)
  - payment_asked absent → true (payment_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
