# Case banking-007-at-04: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-007-at-04:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Mara Ellwood): I can see the sent status, but I need to know what stage the transfer has reached. Can you check whether there is confirmation that the beneficiary received it? [facts: requester='Mara Ellwood', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellwood", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Mara Ellwood (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → secure_chat (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → False (by `read-requester`).
10. Rule `read-subject` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).

16. Note from `read-payment`: event 4 (H&V Payment Team): Our current trace shows the instruction sent onward from H&V. The downstream processing status is pending, and our trace does not confirm receipt by the beneficiary. [facts: payment_status='SENT']

## What the agent said

> The payment system has already been asked, so the answer is in the case. Now I'll reply.
> I've sent the reply to Mara. The payment record shows the transfer as SENT, and there is no confirmation that the beneficiary has received it. That is all the record shows, so the reply doesn't claim any later stage.
> 
> I didn't ask the payment system again. It had already been checked, and a second ask was refused for that reason. The case is closed as replied.
