# Case banking-008-at-03: The purpose recorded with the transfer

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Elena Marlow asked, in secure chat, what purpose text her transfer to Mallow Pottery Works for a kiln repair recorded. The desk could not confirm her identity (verified=False), classified the request as a record lookup on a payment, and closed the case in WAITING with no actions taken and no record disclosed. The follow-up requests to query the payment system, redirect to the secure process and escalate to a person were all refused because the case was already in WAITING, so the payment system's answer is still outstanding and the purpose text has not been looked up or given to her.
