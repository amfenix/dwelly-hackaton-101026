# Case banking-008-at-03: The purpose recorded with the transfer

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Elena Marlow asked, in secure chat, what purpose text her transfer to Mallow Pottery Works for a kiln repair recorded. The desk shows her as not verified, classified the request as a question about a transfer, and closed the case in waiting because the payment system had been asked but no answer was in. The agent's later payment lookup and its escalation to a person were both refused because the case was no longer in the triaged state, so no payment record was read and nothing has been reported about the purpose text. The record does not show a person being assigned; someone still needs to confirm her identity and look up the purpose text on her instruction.
