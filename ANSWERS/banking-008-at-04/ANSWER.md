## Actions taken

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `REPLY_PENDING`: the agent asked for `reply`, rule `payment-reply` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment)
  - payment_status present → true (payment_status=OTHER)
- `REPLY_PENDING` → `REPLIED`: rule `do-reply`.
  - state = REPLY_PENDING → true (state=REPLY_PENDING)

Facts established:

- requester: **Elena Marlow**
- role: **customer**

- payment_asked: **True**
