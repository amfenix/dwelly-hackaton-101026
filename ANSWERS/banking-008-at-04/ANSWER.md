# Case banking-008-at-04: The purpose recorded with the transfer

**Decision: reply**  (final state `REPLIED`)

## Summary

Elena Marlow asked, in a secure chat, what purpose text her payment instruction to Mallow Pottery Works recorded. The desk found the transfer, but its payment status came back as "OTHER", and it sent a reply saying the record shows no recognized payment status and that no new transfer was made. The payment journal did show the purpose text "Deposit for kiln repair estimate", but the reply never gave it to her, so her question remains unanswered. The desk also still lists her as unverified, despite her saying she had completed identity checks, and that was left unresolved.

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `REPLY_PENDING`: the agent asked for `reply`, rule `payment-reply` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment)
  - payment_status present → true (payment_status=OTHER)
- `REPLY_PENDING` → `REPLIED`: rule `do-reply`.
  - state = REPLY_PENDING → true (state=REPLY_PENDING)
