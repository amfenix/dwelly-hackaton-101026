## What the agent said

> I sent the reply, and the case is now closed. The payment system has already been checked, and its answer was a status the desk classes as "OTHER". The reply reports that answer and claims nothing beyond what the record shows.
> 
> I didn't see the text of the reply, so I can't tell you whether it includes the purpose text you entered.
> 
> The desk's records still show you as not verified, even though you said you'd completed the identity checks in the secure chat.
