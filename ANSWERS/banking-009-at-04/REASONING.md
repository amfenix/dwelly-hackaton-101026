## What the agent said

> I've replied to Mara. The payment record shows the transfer to her property manager as sent for £648.20, which matches the final payment line. I did not confirm what she entered in the draft, because the draft isn't part of the completed record.
> 
> I did not look into the £684.20 she remembers, and no dispute or review was opened. The case is closed on the reply.
