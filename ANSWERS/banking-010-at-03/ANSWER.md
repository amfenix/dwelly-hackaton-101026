# Case banking-010-at-03: Refund visible in the account

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Elowen Marr, an unverified customer on secure chat, asked whether an incoming £42.80 entry from Northmere Home Supplies is the refund for her specific transfer. The desk requested the incoming-payments check and closed the case as waiting because no result had come back, so nothing confirms whether the refund has arrived. The agent's attempts to re-ask the incoming system and to escalate to a person were both refused because the case was already in WAITING, so no one has been handed the case and it is still open.
