# Case banking-010-at-03: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-010-at-03:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Elowen Marr): I am escalating this because Northmere Home Supplies said the £42.80 might be returned. Please check whether the incoming entry is for that specific transfer; I do not want it confused with another payment. [facts: requester='Elowen Marr', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Elowen Marr", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Elowen Marr (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → secure_chat (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → False (by `read-requester`).

11. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-010-at-03:read-subject:2).
12. Note from `read-subject`: event 2 (Elowen Marr): I am escalating this because Northmere Home Supplies said the £42.80 might be returned.

13. `find_subject` found {"amount": "42.80", "counterparty": "Northmere Home Supplies"}.
14. `amount`: not known → 42.80 (by `read-subject`).
15. `counterparty`: not known → Northmere Home Supplies (by `read-subject`).

20. Called `check_incoming` (attempt 1, key banking-010-at-03:read-incoming:4).

33. Rule `read-business` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
34. Called `check_business` (attempt 1, key banking-010-at-03:read-business:8).

59. Rule `incoming-waits` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system = incoming → true (next_system=incoming); incoming_asked → true (incoming_asked=True); incoming_found absent → true (incoming_found=not known). The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.

61. The case closed in `WAITING`: **wait**.
62. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "incoming"}.
63. Refused `ask_system` in `WAITING`: payment-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = payment is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = payment is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); incoming-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); incoming_asked absent is false (incoming_asked=True); recurring-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = recurring is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = recurring is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); card-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = card is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = card is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); access-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = access is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = access is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); business-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = business is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = business is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); documents-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = documents is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = documents is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); tariff-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = tariff is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = tariff is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming).

## What the agent said

> The incoming-payments check for the £42.80 from Northmere Home Supplies has already been requested, and the case is now waiting on that result. I can't confirm anything about the refund yet. I tried to ask the incoming system again and the desk refused, because that check is already on record and the case is in a waiting state.
> 
> So far nothing shows that a refund has arrived, and the case doesn't say which entry would match your original transfer. I won't tie any incoming entry to that transfer until the record shows it. Your identity also isn't verified on this chat yet, which may limit what can be shared once the result is in.
> 
> I'm taking no further action now. The case stays open until the incoming result comes back or a person picks it up.
