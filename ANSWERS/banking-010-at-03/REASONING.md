# Case banking-010-at-03: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-010-at-03:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Elowen Marr): I am escalating this because Northmere Home Supplies said the £42.80 might be returned. Please check whether the incoming entry is for that specific transfer; I do not want it confused with another payment. [facts: requester='Elowen Marr', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Elowen Marr", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Elowen Marr (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → secure_chat (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → False (by `read-requester`).

11. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-010-at-03:read-subject:2).
12. Note from `read-subject`: event 2 (Elowen Marr): I am escalating this because Northmere Home Supplies said the £42.80 might be returned.

55. `next_system`: not known → incoming (by `asked-incoming`).
56. Rule `incoming-waits` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system = incoming → true (next_system=incoming); incoming_asked → true (incoming_asked=True); incoming_found absent → true (incoming_found=not known). The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
57. State `TRIAGED` → `WAITING` (by `incoming-waits`).
58. The case closed in `WAITING`: **wait**.
59. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "incoming"}.
60. Refused `ask_system` in `WAITING`: payment-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = payment is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = payment is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); incoming-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); incoming_asked absent is false (incoming_asked=True); recurring-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = recurring is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = recurring is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); card-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = card is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = card is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); access-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = access is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = access is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); business-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = business is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = business is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming); documents-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = documents is false (args.system=incoming); next_system = documents is false (next_system=incoming); next_system absent is false (next_system=incoming).
61. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Customer Elowen Marr (secure chat, not verified) asks whether a £42.80 refund from Northmere Home Supplies has arrived, tied to her outgoing £42.80 transfer. The incoming system was already queried, but the case holds no result or matching entry (confirmation: none). The case is in WAITING, so a second incoming query was refused. I can't confirm any refund. Please check incoming entries against that specific transfer, complete identity verification, and reply to the customer. Do not confuse it with other payments."}.
62. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).

## What the agent said

> I couldn't confirm whether the £42.80 refund from Northmere Home Supplies has reached the account, and nothing more can be done on this case right now.
> 
> - **No result in the case:** The incoming-payments check was already run, but the case holds no result or matching entry. The confirmation field says "none", so I can't say a refund has arrived.
> - **Second check refused:** The desk wouldn't run the incoming check again, because the case is in a waiting state and that check had already been asked.
> - **Escalation refused:** My escalation to a person was also refused for the same reason. The case is still open, and I've left it waiting.
> - **Identity not verified:** The customer, Elowen Marr, is also not yet verified.
> 
> Someone will need to match any incoming entry to the specific £42.80 transfer to Northmere Home Supplies. She asked that it not be confused with another payment.
