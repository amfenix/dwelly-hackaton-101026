# Case banking-011-at-03: When will my standing order run?

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, writing over secure chat, asked the desk to check when her active monthly household contribution standing order is next due. The desk identified the request as a question about a standing order and asked the recurring-payments system for the date, but no answer had come back when the case closed in a waiting state. A second ask to that system and a redirect to the secure process were both refused, so no date was given to her, and she remains unverified. The record does not say who will pick the case up, only that it is waiting on the recurring system's reply.

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `WAITING`: rule `recurring-waits` — The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - next_system = recurring → true (next_system=recurring)
  - recurring_asked → true (recurring_asked=True)
  - recurring_status absent → true (recurring_status=not known)
