# Case banking-011-at-03: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-011-at-03:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): I can see that my monthly household contribution standing order is active, but I cannot remember when it is next due. Please check the date for me; I am planning my budget. [facts: requester='Mara Ellison', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellison", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Mara Ellison (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).

54. `request_type`: not known → question (by `triage`).
55. `subject`: not known → standing_order (by `triage`).
56. State `READING` → `TRIAGED` (by `triage`).
57. Rule `asked-recurring` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system absent → true (next_system=not known); recurring_asked → true (recurring_asked=True).
58. `next_system`: not known → recurring (by `asked-recurring`).
59. Rule `recurring-waits` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system = recurring → true (next_system=recurring); recurring_asked → true (recurring_asked=True); recurring_status absent → true (recurring_status=not known). The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
60. State `TRIAGED` → `WAITING` (by `recurring-waits`).
61. The case closed in `WAITING`: **wait**.
62. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "recurring"}.
63. Refused `ask_system` in `WAITING`: payment-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = payment is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = payment is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); incoming-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = incoming is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = incoming is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); recurring-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); recurring_asked absent is false (recurring_asked=True); card-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = card is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = card is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); access-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = access is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = access is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); business-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = business is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = business is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); documents-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = documents is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = documents is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); document_ready = false is not known (document_ready=not known); tariff-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = tariff is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = tariff is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring).

## What the agent said

> I've stopped here without answering the customer. The case is in a final WAITING state, and I haven't been able to give Mara Ellison her next due date.
> 
> The recurring system has already been asked once, so the desk refused a second ask. No due date has been recorded in the case. Mara is also not verified. I didn't want to reply with a date the records don't show, so I'm leaving the case with the desk until the recurring system's answer is in it.
