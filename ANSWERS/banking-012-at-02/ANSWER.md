## Actions taken

- `send_for_confirmation` (change: standing_order, amount=68.00, to: Mira Ellery), by rule `do-confirm`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `CONFIRM_PENDING`: rule `change-needs-confirmation` — A change is confirmed by the customer in the secure portal, not in chat or by email.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - request_type = change → true (request_type=change)
  - confirmation = none → true (confirmation=none)
  - registration_asked absent → true (registration_asked=not known)
- `CONFIRM_PENDING` → `CONFIRMATION_SENT`: rule `do-confirm`.
  - state = CONFIRM_PENDING → true (state=CONFIRM_PENDING)
