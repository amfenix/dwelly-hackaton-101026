## What the agent said

> The case is waiting on Mira to confirm the change in her secure portal session, so I've taken no further action.
> 
> - **What has happened:** the change from £42.00 to £68.00 a month has been sent to her for confirmation. The standing order itself is still £42.00.
> - **Why I'm not submitting it:** she hasn't confirmed, and she isn't verified. She also gave the instruction in chat rather than in the portal. The bank can't make the change for her or approve it on her behalf.
> - **What happens next:** once she confirms in the portal, the case can move on.
