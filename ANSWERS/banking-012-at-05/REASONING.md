# Case banking-012-at-05: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-012-at-05:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 5 (Mira Ellery): I confirm the change to £68.00 per month for my standing order to Westmere Garden Cooperative. [facts: requester='Mira Ellery', role='customer', channel='secure_portal', verified=True]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mira Ellery", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_portal", "verified": true}.
6. `requester`: not known → Mira Ellery (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → secure_portal (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → True (by `read-requester`).

73. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Verified customer Mira Ellery confirmed in the secure portal (event 5) a change to her standing order to Westmere Garden Cooperative, £42.00 to £68.00 per month. The case is in state WAITING with request_type=change and next_system=recurring. submit_request and ask_system(recurring) were both refused because the state is not TRIAGED. The standing order has not been changed. Please triage and apply the confirmed change, or confirm the next step."}.
74. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).
