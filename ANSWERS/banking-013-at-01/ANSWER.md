# Case banking-013-at-01: Cancellation of a Future Payment Instruction

**Decision: escalate**  (final state `ESCALATED`)

## Summary

The customer asked to cancel the next scheduled run of their recurring studio-rent payment (a standing order) before it starts, and to get confirmation. The desk did not cancel anything: it refused both submitting the request and asking the recurring system, because the customer was not verified and no confirmation had been given. It escalated the case, and a person still needs to verify the customer and confirm the cancellation instruction before the next run.

## Actions taken

- none

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ESCALATED`: the agent asked for `escalate`, rule `agent-escalates` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)

Facts established:

- subject: **standing_order**
- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **False**
- request_type: **instruction**
- next_system: **recurring**
- reason: **AGENT_ESCALATED**

Where they came from:

- event 1 (H&V): Your recurring studio-rent payment instruction is active. The next scheduled run has not started. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]

## Escalated

Yes: the case ended as **escalate** in `ESCALATED`.
