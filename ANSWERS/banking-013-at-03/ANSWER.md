# Case banking-013-at-03: Cancellation of a Future Payment Instruction

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Elodie Mercer, a verified customer on the secure portal, asked to cancel the future run of her recurring studio-rent payment instruction. The desk classified it as an instruction about a standing order and asked the recurring-payments system about it, then closed the case at that step. No cancellation was made, the system's answer isn't in the record, and the recorded confirmation is still "none", so whether the run gets cancelled is left for a person to follow up.

  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = recurring → true (args.system=recurring)
  - next_system = recurring → true (next_system=recurring)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=recurring)
  - recurring_asked absent → true (recurring_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=instruction)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
