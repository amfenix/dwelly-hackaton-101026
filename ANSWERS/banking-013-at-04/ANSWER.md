# Case banking-013-at-04: Cancellation of a Future Payment Instruction

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Elodie Mercer, a verified customer on the secure portal, confirmed she wants to cancel the next run of her recurring studio-rent payment instruction. The desk classified this as a standing-order instruction, found that the recurring system had already been asked, and closed the case in a waiting state because that system's answer had not come in. The agent's later attempts to submit the request, ask the system again and escalate were all refused because the case was no longer in the triaged state, so the cancellation has not been carried out or confirmed to her, and it is still waiting on the recurring system's reply.

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `WAITING`: rule `recurring-waits` — The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - next_system = recurring → true (next_system=recurring)
  - recurring_asked → true (recurring_asked=True)
  - recurring_status absent → true (recurring_status=not known)
