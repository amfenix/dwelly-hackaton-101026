# Case banking-013-at-04: how the decision was reached

70. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Verified customer Elodie Mercer (secure portal, identity checked, explicit confirmation given, nothing instructed outside portal) asks to cancel the next scheduled run of her active studio-rent standing order; the run has not started. Case is stuck in WAITING: submit_request and reply were both refused because the state is not TRIAGED and recurring_status is not known. Please cancel the next run if the records allow it, and confirm to the customer only once it is done."}.
71. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).
