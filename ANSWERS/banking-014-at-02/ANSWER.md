# Case banking-014-at-02: Direct Debit mandate status

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellery, who was not verified, asked over secure chat whether her Direct Debit mandate to Northmere Water Services is still active, and said she did not want it cancelled. The desk treated it as a question and put it to the recurring payments system, which holds Direct Debit mandates; the request went through, but the record shows no answer yet. Nothing was cancelled or changed, and the mandate's status still has to be passed back to her once that system replies.

  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = recurring → true (args.system=recurring)
  - next_system = recurring → true (next_system=recurring)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=recurring)
  - recurring_asked absent → true (recurring_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
