# Case banking-014-at-03: Direct Debit mandate status

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Mara Ellery asked over secure chat whether her Direct Debit mandate to Northmere Water Services is still active, and said it should not be cancelled. The desk classified it as a question, queried the recurring-payments system, and put the case in a waiting state because that system's answer has not come back. A second request to that system was refused because the case was already waiting, and no action was taken on the mandate. Mara is also not verified, and the case closed as final in the waiting state, but the record does not say who will pick it up or when.
