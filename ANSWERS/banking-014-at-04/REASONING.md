## What the agent said

> I sent the customer a reply with the result of the records check: the Direct Debit mandate to Northmere Water Services is currently active. The desk accepted the reply and the case is closed.
> 
> The customer asked only for the mandate's status, so nothing was cancelled or changed. The facts also show the customer is not verified. I didn't treat that as a reason to hold the status back, because it is a read-only answer.
