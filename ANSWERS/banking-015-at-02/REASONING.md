## What the agent said

> I've submitted Mara Ellison's instruction to cancel her Northmere Fitness Direct Debit mandate, and the desk accepted it. The case is now in the REQUESTED state and closed.
> 
> She was verified on the call, the portal shows the mandate as active, and her instruction was clear. She also confirmed she understands this cancels the mandate at the bank, not her agreement with Northmere Fitness. I didn't query the recurring-payments system first, because the case already identified the mandate.
