# Case banking-015-at-04: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-015-at-04:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): I’ve completed your identification checks. Please cancel my Northmere Fitness Direct Debit mandate; I understand this is an instruction to my bank, not a cancellation of my agreement with the recipient. [facts: requester='Mara Ellison', role='customer', channel='verified_call']
5. Note from `read-requester`: event 3 (H&V service agent): I completed the required identification checks and reviewed the collection-stage information. I cannot rule out a collection already being processed, so that needs separate reconciliation. [facts: verified=True]
6. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellison", "role": "customer", "channel": "verified_call", "verified": true}.
7. `requester`: not known → Mara Ellison (by `read-requester`).
8. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
9. `channel`: not known → verified_call (by `read-requester`).
10. `verified`: not known → True (by `read-requester`).
11. Rule `read-subject` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
12. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-015-at-04:read-subject:2).
13. Note from `read-subject`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): I’ve completed your identification checks. Please cancel my Northmere Fitness Direct Debit mandate; I understand this is an instruction to my bank, not a cancellation of my agreement with the recipient. [facts: counterparty='Northmere Fitness']
14. `find_subject` found {"counterparty": "Northmere Fitness"}.
15. `counterparty`: not known → Northmere Fitness (by `read-subject`).
16. Rule `read-payment` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
17. Called `check_payment` (attempt 1, key banking-015-at-04:read-payment:3).
18. `check_payment` found {}.

23. Called `check_recurring` (attempt 1, key banking-015-at-04:read-recurring:5).
24. Note from `read-recurring`: event 4 (H&V Direct Debit service): I have submitted Mara Ellison’s checked instruction to cancel the Northmere Fitness mandate. This submission records her instruction; I am not authorising it on her behalf. [facts: recurring_asked=True]
25. `check_recurring` found {"recurring_asked": true}.
26. `recurring_asked`: not known → True (by `read-recurring`).

## What the agent said

> I couldn't submit the cancellation of the Northmere Fitness Direct Debit mandate, and I've left the case open for a person to pick up.
> 
> The case is in a WAITING state, and the desk's records still show confirmation as "none". The desk only accepts a mandate cancellation once that confirmation is recorded as given. Mara Ellison is verified, and her instruction on the call was clear, but the desk hasn't recorded it as confirmation.
> 
> I tried submitting the cancellation and asking the recurring system again. Both were refused, and the refusals cite the WAITING state and the missing confirmation. The mandate is still active, so Northmere Fitness can still collect.
