## What the agent said

> I've replied to Mara. The bank's records show her rent standing order was not executed for this cycle. That matches what her landlord is seeing.
> 
> The records don't give a reason for the non-execution. The reply therefore only reports the recorded status. I didn't look into the cause or restart the payment.
> 
> The case is closed as replied. Mara's identity is not verified on this chat, so any follow-up that changes the standing order or makes the payment would need that check first.
