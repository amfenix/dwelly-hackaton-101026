# Case banking-017-at-04: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.

## What the agent said

> I sent the reply. The recurring-payments record shows this month's rent standing order as not executed. It shows no confirmation of any payment going out. I didn't state a reason for the failure, because the record doesn't give one.
> 
> The case still shows Mara Ellery as not verified. The reply therefore sticks to what the record shows.
