57. State `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING` (by `recurring-ask`).
58. Rule `do-ask` fired: state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING).
59. Called `ask_system` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-01:do-ask:17).

## What the agent said

> I've asked the recurring payments system to check the two £34.80 payments to Northmere Heating. The case still shows no answer from it. Because of that, I haven't established whether the two payments are duplicates, and I haven't cancelled or removed anything.
> 
> The next step is to read the recurring system's answer once it's in the case. If the records show the two payments are duplicates, the removal can go ahead after that.
