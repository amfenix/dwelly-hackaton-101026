## What the agent said

> The case doesn't yet show whether the two payments are duplicates. The facts point to the recurring system as the next place to check, so I'll ask it before changing anything.
> I asked the recurring system about the two £34.80 payments to Northmere Heating. Its answer isn't in the case yet, so I don't know whether they are duplicates. I haven't removed or changed anything.
> 
> The case is closed on this step. A person will pick it up from here.
