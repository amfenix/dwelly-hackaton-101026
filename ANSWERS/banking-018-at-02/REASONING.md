# Case banking-018-at-02: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): After completing H&V's identity checks, I asked you to escalate this and remove the duplicate. I do not know which line is the duplicate. [facts: requester='Mara Ellison', role='customer', channel='verified_call', verified=True]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellison", "role": "customer", "channel": "verified_call", "verified": true}.
6. `requester`: not known → Mara Ellison (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → verified_call (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → True (by `read-requester`).
10. Rule `read-subject` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
11. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-subject:2).
12. Note from `read-subject`: initial request (system): I can see two future payments of £34.80 to Northmere Heating. Please check whether they are duplicates and remove the duplicate. [facts: amount='34.80', counterparty='Northmere Heating']
13. `find_subject` found {"amount": "34.80", "counterparty": "Northmere Heating"}.
14. `amount`: not known → 34.80 (by `read-subject`).
15. `counterparty`: not known → Northmere Heating (by `read-subject`).
16. Rule `read-payment` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).

34. Rule `read-documents` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
35. Called `check_documents` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-documents:9).
36. `check_documents` found {}.
37. Rule `read-tariff` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
38. Called `check_tariff` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-tariff:10).
39. `check_tariff` found {}.

43. Rule `read-confirmation` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
44. Called `check_confirmation` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-confirmation:12).
45. Note from `read-confirmation`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): After completing H&V's identity checks, I asked you to escalate this and remove the duplicate. I do not know which line is the duplicate. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]
46. `check_confirmation` found {"confirmation": "none", "instructed_outside_portal": false}.
47. `confirmation`: not known → none (by `read-confirmation`).
48. `instructed_outside_portal`: not known → False (by `read-confirmation`).
49. Rule `triage` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
50. Classifier (jev jev-latest) on `request_type`: instruction, confidence 0.92 → instruction.
51. Classifier (jev jev-latest) on `subject`: standing_order, confidence 0.68 → standing_order.
52. `request_type`: not known → instruction (by `triage`).
53. `subject`: not known → standing_order (by `triage`).
54. State `READING` → `TRIAGED` (by `triage`).
55. Rule `route-recurring` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system absent → true (next_system=not known); subject in [standing_order, direct_debit] → true (subject=standing_order).
56. `next_system`: not known → recurring (by `route-recurring`).
57. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "recurring"}.
58. Rule `recurring-ask` (on `ask_system`) fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); args.system = recurring → true (args.system=recurring); next_system = recurring → true (next_system=recurring); next_system absent → false (next_system=recurring); recurring_asked absent → true (recurring_asked=not known); request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=instruction).
59. State `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING` (by `recurring-ask`).
60. Rule `do-ask` fired: state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING).
61. Called `ask_system` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:do-ask:16).
62. Action in the world: `ask_system` {"system": "recurring", "about": "standing_order", "amount": "34.80"}.
63. `ask_system` found {}.
64. State `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED` (by `do-ask`).
65. The case closed in `ASKED`: **ask_system**.

## What the agent said

> I've checked the recurring payments system for the two £34.80 payments to Northmere Heating, and that is as far as I can take this case now. The case is closed on that step, and I haven't removed or changed either payment.
> 
> The case record shows no result from that check yet. Until it does, I can't tell whether the two lines are duplicates or which one would be the duplicate. Mara doesn't know which line to remove either, so removing one now would be a guess.
