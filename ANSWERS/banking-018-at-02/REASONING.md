# Case banking-018-at-02: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): After completing H&V's identity checks, I asked you to escalate this and remove the duplicate. I do not know which line is the duplicate. [facts: requester='Mara Ellison', role='customer', channel='verified_call', verified=True]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellison", "role": "customer", "channel": "verified_call", "verified": true}.
6. `requester`: not known → Mara Ellison (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → verified_call (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → True (by `read-requester`).
10. Rule `read-subject` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
11. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-subject:2).
12. Note from `read-subject`: initial request (system): I can see two future payments of £34.80 to Northmere Heating. Please check whether they are duplicates and remove the duplicate. [facts: amount='34.80', counterparty='Northmere Heating']
13. `find_subject` found {"amount": "34.80", "counterparty": "Northmere Heating"}.

34. Rule `read-documents` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
35. Called `check_documents` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-documents:9).
36. `check_documents` found {}.
37. Rule `read-registration` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
38. Called `check_registration` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-registration:10).
39. `check_registration` found {}.
40. Rule `read-confirmation` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
41. Called `check_confirmation` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:read-confirmation:11).
42. Note from `read-confirmation`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): After completing H&V's identity checks, I asked you to escalate this and remove the duplicate. I do not know which line is the duplicate. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]

44. `confirmation`: not known → none (by `read-confirmation`).
45. `instructed_outside_portal`: not known → False (by `read-confirmation`).
46. Rule `triage` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
47. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `request_type`: instruction → instruction.
48. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `subject`: standing_order → standing_order.
49. `request_type`: not known → instruction (by `triage`).
50. `subject`: not known → standing_order (by `triage`).
51. State `READING` → `TRIAGED` (by `triage`).
52. Rule `route-recurring` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system absent → true (next_system=not known); subject in [standing_order, direct_debit] → true (subject=standing_order).
53. `next_system`: not known → recurring (by `route-recurring`).
54. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "recurring"}.
55. Rule `recurring-ask` (on `ask_system`) fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); args.system = recurring → true (args.system=recurring); next_system = recurring → true (next_system=recurring); next_system absent → false (next_system=recurring); recurring_asked absent → true (recurring_asked=not known); request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=instruction).
56. State `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING` (by `recurring-ask`).
57. Rule `do-ask` fired: state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING).
58. Called `ask_system` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-02:do-ask:15).

60. `ask_system` found {}.
61. State `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED` (by `do-ask`).
62. The case closed in `ASKED`: **ask_system**.

## What the agent said

> I've checked the recurring payments system for the two £34.80 payments to Northmere Heating. I haven't removed or changed anything. The check didn't add any new facts to the case, so I still don't know whether the two lines are duplicates or which one would be the duplicate.
> 
> Mara is verified and has asked for the duplicate to be removed, but she doesn't know which line it is. Any cancellation has to wait until the records show how the two lines relate.
