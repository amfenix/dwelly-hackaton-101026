# Case banking-018-at-04: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-04:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): After completing H&V's identity checks, I asked you to escalate this and remove the duplicate. I do not know which line is the duplicate. [facts: requester='Mara Ellison', role='customer', channel='verified_call', verified=True]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellison", "role": "customer", "channel": "verified_call", "verified": true}.
6. `requester`: not known → Mara Ellison (by `read-requester`).
7. `role`: not known → customer (by `read-requester`).
8. `channel`: not known → verified_call (by `read-requester`).
9. `verified`: not known → True (by `read-requester`).
10. Rule `read-subject` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
11. Called `find_subject` (attempt 1, key banking-018-at-04:read-subject:2).

13. `find_subject` found {"amount": "34.80", "counterparty": "Northmere Heating"}.

## What the agent said

> I've sent the reply to the customer, and the case is closed.
> 
> The payment system has already been checked, and its answer was "OTHER". That answer doesn't show the two £34.80 lines to Northmere Heating are duplicates, and the customer can't say which line is the duplicate. So I didn't remove or cancel anything. The reply reports only what the record shows.
> 
> I didn't query the recurring system, which holds standing orders, because the case pointed to the payment system as the next step. If the customer comes back wanting the two lines checked further, that would be the place to look.
