# Case banking-019-at-03: Standing order date change

**Decision: send_for_confirmation**  (final state `CONFIRMATION_SENT`)

## Summary

Maeve Ellery asked the desk to check whether her Willow Yard Studios standing order run on 18 September 2025 could still be moved to 22 September, and to send any eligible change to her for confirmation. The desk sent the change to her for confirmation, since a change has to be confirmed by the customer in the secure portal, and nothing on the standing order has been altered. The desk never established the order's processing stage, because its later request to the recurring system was refused after the case had closed. So whether the run can still be moved is unknown, and the change takes effect only if it is eligible and she confirms it, which she has not yet done.

The request:

> I want to move the date of my active monthly standing order to Willow Yard Studios from 18 September 2025 to 22 September 2025. Please check whether the next run can still be changed and send the change to me for secure confirmation.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-08-24T09:00:00Z · Secure portal — H&V secure portal → Maeve Ellery

> Standing order status: active. Next scheduled run: 18 September 2025.

2. 2025-08-24T09:47:00Z · Secure chat — Maeve Ellery → H&V service agent

> I’m escalating my request to move the next run of my standing order to Willow Yard Studios from 18 September to 22 September 2025. Please check its processing stage and send any eligible change to me for confirmation.

3. 2025-08-24T10:34:00Z · Internal note — H&V service agent → H&V case record

> I checked the active standing order and its next-run stage. The 18 September 2025 run is not yet being processed, so I can send the requested date change to Maeve for her secure confirmation.

Attachments: none.

  - state = READING → true (state=READING)

  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - request_type = change → true (request_type=change)
  - confirmation = none → true (confirmation=none)
- `CONFIRM_PENDING` → `CONFIRMATION_SENT`: rule `do-confirm`.
  - state = CONFIRM_PENDING → true (state=CONFIRM_PENDING)
