## What the agent said

> Asking isn't allowed for a change request, so I'll submit the confirmed change.
> I submitted Maeve Ellery's confirmed change to the recurring system that carries out standing-order changes. The change moves the next run of her standing order to Willow Yard Studios from 18 September 2025 to 22 September 2025. The desk accepted the request and the case is now in the REQUESTED state.
> 
> I could not check the processing stage myself. The desk refused my attempt to query the recurring system for a change request, so I'm relying on the earlier portal message saying the run wasn't yet being processed. The recurring system may still reject the change if the run has since moved into processing.
> 
> Nothing further is needed from the customer.
