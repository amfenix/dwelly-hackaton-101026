## What the agent said

> I've asked the recurring-payments system for the standing orders and Direct Debits linked to Elena Wren's account. The case is now in the ASKED state, and the desk has recorded that as its final step.
> 
> I couldn't send a reply yet. The desk refused it because the recurring-payments answer isn't in the case, so there is nothing to report to the customer. The request is left open for a person to pick up.
> 
> The customer hasn't been verified yet, and that may matter before any account details are shared with them.
