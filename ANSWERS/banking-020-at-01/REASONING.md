# Case banking-020-at-01: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

## What the agent said

> I asked the recurring-payments system about the standing orders and Direct Debits linked to Elena Wren's account. That was the next step, and the case is now closed at this stage.
> 
> The system's answer hasn't come back into the case yet. The case facts still show nothing about which instructions are active, so I can't list any. The customer's identity is also still unverified. A reply should only report what the record shows, and it should wait for the answer and the desk's verification rules.
