# Case banking-020-at-02: What to Check Before Closing an Account

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Elena Wren asked, over secure chat, which regular payments are still active before she makes any closure plans. The desk classified this as a question about a standing order and sent a query to the recurring-payments system, and the case closed at that step. The system's answer has not come back, so no list of active payments has been given to her, and the follow-up reply was refused because the case was no longer in the state that allows one. The desk also records her as not verified, despite her saying she completed the account-holder checks, so a person may need to look at that.

## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: recurring, about: standing_order), by rule `do-ask`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `recurring-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = recurring → true (args.system=recurring)
  - next_system = recurring → true (next_system=recurring)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=recurring)
  - recurring_asked absent → true (recurring_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)

Facts established:

- requester: **Elena Wren**

- verified: **False**
- subject: **standing_order**
- confirmation: **none**
