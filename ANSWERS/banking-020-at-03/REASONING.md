# Case banking-020-at-03: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.

3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-020-at-03:read-requester:1).

66. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "recurring"}.
67. Refused `ask_system` in `WAITING`: payment-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = payment is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = payment is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); incoming-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = incoming is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = incoming is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); recurring-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); recurring_asked absent is false (recurring_asked=True); card-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = card is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = card is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); access-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = access is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = access is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); business-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = business is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = business is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); documents-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = documents is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = documents is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring); document_ready = false is not known (document_ready=not known); tariff-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = tariff is false (args.system=recurring); next_system = tariff is false (next_system=recurring); next_system absent is false (next_system=recurring).

## What the agent said

> I've stopped here, and the case stays open for a person to pick up. I haven't answered Elena's question yet.
> 
> - **Standing-order check:** the recurring-payments system was already asked, and its answer hasn't come back. A second request was refused because the case is in a waiting state.
> - **Verification:** the desk's record still shows the customer as not verified, even though she says she completed the account-holder checks in secure chat. I can't treat her as verified or list her instructions until the desk's own check confirms it.
> 
> Once the recurring-payments answer is in the case, the reply can list her active standing orders and Direct Debits and cover what to think about before closing.
