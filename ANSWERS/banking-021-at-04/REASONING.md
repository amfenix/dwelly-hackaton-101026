## What the agent said

> I sent the reply. The card record already showed the replacement card as DISPATCHED, so I didn't need to query the card system again. The desk writes the wording, so I haven't seen the exact text.
> 
> The record shows dispatch only. It doesn't confirm that the card has been delivered. Nothing in the case marks Mara Ellison as verified, so I made no changes to her account.
