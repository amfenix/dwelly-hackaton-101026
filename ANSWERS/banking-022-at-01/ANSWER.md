# Case banking-022-at-01: Lost card blocked

**Decision: submit_request**  (final state `REQUESTED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, a verified caller, reported her debit card missing after a visit to Alder Quay Market and asked for it to be blocked immediately. The desk registered a request with the card team about the card, and the case closed as requested. The record does not show the block itself being carried out or confirmed, so that remains with the card team.
