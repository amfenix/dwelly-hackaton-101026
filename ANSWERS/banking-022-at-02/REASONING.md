# Case banking-022-at-02: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-022-at-02:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 1 (Mara Ellison): After H&V completed its identification checks, I reported that my debit card was missing after a visit to Alder Quay Market. I asked you to block it immediately; no security details were recorded in the call note. [facts: requester='Mara Ellison', role='customer', channel='verified_call', verified=True]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellison", "role": "customer", "channel": "verified_call", "verified": true}.
6. `requester`: not known → Mara Ellison (by `read-requester`).

50. `request_type`: not known → instruction (by `triage`).
51. `subject`: not known → card (by `triage`).
52. State `READING` → `TRIAGED` (by `triage`).

54. `next_system`: not known → card (by `route-card`).
55. Rule `registration-waits` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); registration_asked → true (registration_asked=True); registered absent → true (registered=not known). The team was asked; its answer is not in yet.
56. State `TRIAGED` → `WAITING` (by `registration-waits`).
57. The case closed in `WAITING`: **wait**.
58. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "card"}.
59. Refused `ask_system` in `WAITING`: payment-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = payment is false (args.system=card); next_system = payment is false (next_system=card); next_system absent is false (next_system=card); incoming-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = incoming is false (args.system=card); next_system = incoming is false (next_system=card); next_system absent is false (next_system=card); recurring-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = recurring is false (args.system=card); next_system = recurring is false (next_system=card); next_system absent is false (next_system=card); card-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system absent is false (next_system=card); access-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = access is false (args.system=card); next_system = access is false (next_system=card); next_system absent is false (next_system=card); business-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = business is false (args.system=card); next_system = business is false (next_system=card); next_system absent is false (next_system=card); documents-ask: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); args.system = documents is false (args.system=card); next_system = documents is false (next_system=card); next_system absent is false (next_system=card).
60. The agent asked for `submit_request` {}.
61. Refused `submit_request` in `WAITING`: register: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); request_type = register is false (request_type=instruction); registration_asked absent is false (registration_asked=True); payment-instruction: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = payment is false (next_system=card); request_type = change is false (request_type=instruction); confirmation = given is false (confirmation=none); incoming-instruction: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = incoming is false (next_system=card); request_type = change is false (request_type=instruction); confirmation = given is false (confirmation=none); recurring-instruction: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = recurring is false (next_system=card); request_type = change is false (request_type=instruction); confirmation = given is false (confirmation=none); card-instruction: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); request_type = change is false (request_type=instruction); confirmation = given is false (confirmation=none); access-instruction: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = access is false (next_system=card); request_type = change is false (request_type=instruction); confirmation = given is false (confirmation=none); business-instruction: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = business is false (next_system=card); request_type = change is false (request_type=instruction); confirmation = given is false (confirmation=none); documents-instruction: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); next_system = documents is false (next_system=card); request_type = change is false (request_type=instruction); confirmation = given is false (confirmation=none).
62. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Verified caller Mara Ellison reports her H&V debit card missing after a visit to Alder Quay Market and asks for an immediate block. The case is in WAITING and the desk refused both a card lookup and the block instruction: state is not TRIAGED, request_type is \"instruction\" rather than \"change\", and confirmation is \"none\". The card has not been checked or blocked. Please contact the customer urgently, confirm which card she means if she holds more than one, and block it."}.
63. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).
