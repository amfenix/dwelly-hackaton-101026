# Case banking-022-at-02: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-022-at-02:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 1 (Mara Ellison): After H&V completed its identification checks, I reported that my debit card was missing after a visit to Alder Quay Market. I asked you to block it immediately; no security details were recorded in the call note. [facts: requester='Mara Ellison', role='customer', channel='verified_call', verified=True]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellison", "role": "customer", "channel": "verified_call", "verified": true}.
