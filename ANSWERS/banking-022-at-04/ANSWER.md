# Case banking-022-at-04: Lost card blocked

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, verified on a call, reported her debit card missing after a visit to Alder Quay Market and asked for it to be blocked. The desk found the card already marked BLOCKED and a case (HV-022) already opened and escalated by the service team, whose answer is not in yet, so it closed the case as waiting. The desk took no action itself, and its attempts to send a reply and to submit a new request were both refused because the case was in the waiting state; nothing in the record shows she has been told the card is blocked.
