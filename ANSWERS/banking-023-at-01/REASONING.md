57. The agent asked for `submit_request` {}.
58. Rule `register` (on `submit_request`) fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); request_type = register → true (request_type=register); registration_asked absent → true (registration_asked=not known).

## What the agent said

> I've submitted your request to the team that handles card purchase disputes. They'll investigate the £38.40 purchase at Fern & Finch Books on 14 July 2025. The portal listing doesn't show who made the purchase, and the bank hasn't established that either. That's what the investigation will look into.
> 
> I haven't answered the part of your request about how to protect your card yet. The bank will never ask you for your PIN or password, so don't share them with anyone.
