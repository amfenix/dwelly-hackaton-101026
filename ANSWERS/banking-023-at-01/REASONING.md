52. Rule `register` (on `submit_request`) fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); request_type = register → true (request_type=register); registration_asked absent → true (registration_asked=not known).
53. State `TRIAGED` → `REQUEST_PENDING` (by `register`).
54. Rule `do-request` fired: state = REQUEST_PENDING → true (state=REQUEST_PENDING).
55. Called `register_request` (attempt 1, key banking-023-at-01:do-request:15).
56. Action in the world: `register_request` {"team": "card", "about": "card_payment"}.

## What the agent said

> I've submitted the dispute for the £38.40 Fern & Finch Books card purchase on 14 July 2025, and the case now shows as requested. The desk accepted the request.
> 
> I have not yet told you how to protect your card. The dispute covers the transaction, but it doesn't block or replace the card. I also haven't checked the card system, because the desk refused that lookup for this type of request.
