## What the agent said

> I asked the card system for the restriction category and whether it has been lifted. That step is done and the case is now final, but I couldn't reply to Rowan.
> 
> The card system's answer didn't come back into the case. No card status is on record, so the desk wouldn't let me send a reply. I'm stopping here, and the case goes to a person.
> 
> Rowan Ellery is also not verified. Whoever picks it up should verify them before sharing any card restriction details.
