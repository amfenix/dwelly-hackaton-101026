## What the agent said

> The card system's answer is already in the case, so I'll reply with what it shows.
> I sent the reply. The card record says the card is currently RESTRICTED, and the reason is a temporary security-related restriction. So the restriction has not been lifted. The record gives no more detail than that, so the reply doesn't either.
> 
> The case shows the requester as not verified. The record doesn't say why the card was restricted beyond that category.
> 
> The case is now closed with the reply as its outcome.
