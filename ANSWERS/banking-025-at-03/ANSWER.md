# Case banking-025-at-03: Why a Card Attempt Was Declined

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, a verified customer calling in, asked why her £18.40 payment at North Quay Books was declined. The desk asked the card system about that payment and closed the case, but no answer came back, and the attempt to reply to her was refused because there is no card status on record. Nothing has been told to Mara about why the payment failed, so a person still needs to check the card system for that attempt and give her the reason.

## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: card, about: card_payment, amount: 18.40), by rule `do-ask`

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `card-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = card → true (args.system=card)
  - next_system = card → true (next_system=card)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=card)
  - card_asked absent → true (card_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority, instruction] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
