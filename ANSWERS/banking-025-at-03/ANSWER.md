# Case banking-025-at-03: Why a Card Attempt Was Declined

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, a verified customer on a call, asked why her £18.40 payment at North Quay Books was declined. The desk classified it as a card payment question and sent a query about that payment to the card system, then closed the case at that step. The card system's answer isn't in the record, so the reason for the decline hasn't been given to her and is still open.

## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: card, about: card_payment, amount: 18.40), by rule `do-ask`

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `card-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = card → true (args.system=card)
  - next_system = card → true (next_system=card)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=card)
  - card_asked absent → true (card_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority, instruction] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
