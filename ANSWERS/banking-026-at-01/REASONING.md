## What the agent said

> The customer forgot their PIN and wants the secure process. The right tool for that is redirect_secure.
> I've pointed Maren to the bank's secure process for a forgotten PIN. The request was accepted and the case is closed as redirected.
> 
> She isn't verified in this chat, and the bank never handles a PIN in a message. So the PIN recovery itself happens in the secure process, not here.
