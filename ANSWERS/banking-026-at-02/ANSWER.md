# Case banking-026-at-02: A Safe Route to a Forgotten PIN

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Maren Ellwood, writing over secure chat, said she had forgotten her debit card PIN and asked for the safe way to deal with it. She has not been verified. The desk classed it as an access request, saw that the Access team had already escalated it for the prescribed PIN route, and put the case on hold to wait for their answer, which is not in yet. The agent's later attempts to redirect her to the secure process, ask the access system again and send a reply were all refused because the case was already waiting, so no reply has gone to her and nothing is left for a person beyond awaiting the Access team's response.
