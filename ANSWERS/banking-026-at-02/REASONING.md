# Case banking-026-at-02: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-026-at-02:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 1 (Maren Ellwood): I’ve forgotten the PIN for my H&V debit card and need to use it again. Please tell me the safe way to deal with this; I won’t send my PIN in chat. [facts: requester='Maren Ellwood', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]

58. `next_system`: not known → access (by `asked-access`).
59. Rule `access-waits` fired: state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED); next_system = access → true (next_system=access); access_asked → true (access_asked=True); access_status absent → true (access_status=not known). The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
60. State `TRIAGED` → `WAITING` (by `access-waits`).
61. The case closed in `WAITING`: **wait**.
62. The agent asked for `redirect_secure` {}.

## What the agent said

> The customer needs the bank's secure PIN process, so I'm pointing her to it.
> I couldn't send Maren to the secure PIN process. The desk refused the redirect because the case is in WAITING and not TRIAGED. It also refused a request to the access system, because that system has already been asked (`access_asked` is true).
> 
> The case is final with outcome "wait", and no other tool applies. Maren is not verified, and nothing in her request involves a PIN being shared. I'm leaving the case open for a person to pick up.
