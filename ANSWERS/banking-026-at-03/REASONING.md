# Case banking-026-at-03: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-026-at-03:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 1 (Maren Ellwood): I’ve forgotten the PIN for my H&V debit card and need to use it again. Please tell me the safe way to deal with this; I won’t send my PIN in chat. [facts: requester='Maren Ellwood', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]

47. Rule `triage` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
48. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `request_type`: access → access.
49. Classifier (claude claude-haiku-5-5) on `subject`: card → card.
50. `request_type`: not known → access (by `triage`).
51. `subject`: not known → card (by `triage`).

## What the agent said

> I replied to Maren, and the case is now closed as replied.
> 
> The access system had already answered, so I didn't ask it again. Its answer came back as "other", with no specific PIN-reset route listed. The reply therefore sticks to what the record shows. It does not claim to have reset anything or to have started a PIN change. Maren is also not verified yet, so the bank has not acted on her behalf.
