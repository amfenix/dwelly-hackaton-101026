## What the agent said

> The case is now waiting on the customer, so I'm not taking any further action.
> 
> The bank has already opened the PIN procedure for Maren in the secure portal, and she needs to continue there. My attempt to send a reply was refused because the case is in a waiting state, not a triaged one. No one at the bank can see or handle her PIN.
