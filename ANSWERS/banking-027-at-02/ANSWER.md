# Case banking-027-at-02: Access Restored

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, a customer on a verified call, said she still couldn't sign in to her profile and asked for help restoring access. The desk classified it as an access request and sent a query to the access system, which returned nothing, and the case closed at that step. Nothing has been done to restore her access yet; the agent's closing note says she still needs to be pointed to H&V's secure recovery process, but the record shows no action taken on that.

## What the system received

- Source role: Bank customer
- Bank: Harrow & Vale Bank plc (fictional)
- Created: 2025-09-09 09:00:00 UTC

The request:

> I can’t sign in to my H&V profile after several unsuccessful attempts. Please help me regain access safely so I can review my household spending.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-09-09T09:00:00Z · Secure portal — H&V app → Mara Ellison

> Sign-in declined. Use H&V’s secure recovery process to restore access.

2. 2025-09-09T09:47:00Z · Verified call — Mara Ellison → H&V service agent

> I’ve completed H&V’s identification checks for this call. I still can’t sign in to my profile, and I need help restoring access; I’m not sharing any password or verification code.

## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: access, about: access), by rule `do-ask`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `access-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = access → true (args.system=access)
  - next_system = access → true (next_system=access)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=access)
  - access_asked absent → true (access_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=access)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)

Facts established:

- requester: **Mara Ellison**

- verified: **True**
- subject: **access**
- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **False**
- request_type: **access**
