# Case banking-027-at-02: Access Restored

**Decision: redirect_secure**  (final state `REDIRECTED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, a verified caller, said she still couldn't sign in to her profile and asked for help restoring access. The desk classified this as an access request and redirected her to the secure process in her portal, telling her it checks her identity there, that the bank never asks for passwords, PINs or codes, and that nothing on her profile was changed. The case is closed as redirected, and nothing is left for a person on the desk, though restoring her access depends on her completing the secure process herself.

## Actions taken

- `redirect_secure` (to: Mara Ellison, channel: verified_call), by rule `do-redirect`

  > Please use the secure process in your secure portal to do this; it checks your identity there. We will never ask for your password, PIN or a verification code. Nothing on your profile was changed.


## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `REDIRECT_PENDING`: the agent asked for `redirect_secure`, rule `redirect-to-the-secure-process` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - request_type = access → true (request_type=access)
- `REDIRECT_PENDING` → `REDIRECTED`: rule `do-redirect`.
  - state = REDIRECT_PENDING → true (state=REDIRECT_PENDING)

Facts established:

- requester: **Mara Ellison**
- role: **customer**

- verified: **True**
- subject: **access**
- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **False**
- request_type: **access**
