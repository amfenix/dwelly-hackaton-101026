## What the agent said

> This case is already closed. The desk shows it as requested, with the outcome "submit_request", and no refusals are recorded. So I'm not taking any further action.
> 
> The customer, Elowen Mercer, is verified from the call. She wants her profile phone number replaced because she can no longer use the old phone. Her request has been passed on.
