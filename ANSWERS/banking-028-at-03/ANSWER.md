# Case banking-028-at-03: New phone number in profile

**Decision: send_for_confirmation**  (final state `CONFIRMATION_SENT`)

## Summary

Elowen Mercer, verified on a call, asked to change the phone number on her profile because she no longer has her old phone, and asked for the approved way to confirm a replacement. The desk did not make the change; it sent her a confirmation request for the profile change, since a change has to be confirmed by the customer in the secure portal rather than by email or chat. The case is closed with the confirmation sent, and the record shows nothing further for a person to do beyond her confirming the change.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-09-11T09:00:00Z · External message — Elowen Mercer → Harrow & Vale Bank plc

> I need to change the phone number on my profile because I no longer have access to my old phone. Please tell me the approved way to confirm a replacement; this email is a request, not my authorisation to make the change.

2. 2025-09-11T09:47:00Z · Verified call — Elowen Mercer → H&V service agent

> After you completed H&V’s identification checks, I explained that the old phone is unavailable and asked for this to be escalated. I can confirm the replacement number through a secure bank process.

3. 2025-09-11T10:34:00Z · Secure portal — H&V service agent → H&V secure profile-change process

> I have started the approved phone-number change process following the verified call. I have not changed the profile number or bypassed the old-device check; the customer must confirm the change securely.
