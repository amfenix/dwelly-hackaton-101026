# Case banking-028-at-04: New phone number in profile

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Elowen Mercer, verified on a call, asked to change the phone number on her profile because she no longer has her old phone. The desk did not change the number and left the case waiting: the secure profile-change process has been started, but it still needs her to confirm the replacement number securely, since her email and call are not authorisation. The agent's later attempt to redirect her to the secure process was refused because the case was already in the waiting state and was a change, not an access request, so what remains is for her to confirm in the secure process.

## Actions taken

- none

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `WAITING`: rule `profile-change-waits-for-the-process` — The protected change process is running; it asks the customer to confirm.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - request_type = change → true (request_type=change)
  - subject = profile → true (subject=profile)
  - access_asked → true (access_asked=True)
  - confirmation in [none, requested] → true (confirmation=none)

Facts established:

- requester: **Elowen Mercer**
- role: **customer**
- channel: **verified_call**
- verified: **True**
- subject: **profile**
- access_asked: **True**
- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **True**
- request_type: **change**
- next_system: **access**

Where they came from:

- event 2 (Elowen Mercer): After you completed H&V’s identification checks, I explained that the old phone is unavailable and asked for this to be escalated. I can confirm the replacement number through a secure bank process. [facts: requester='Elowen Mercer', role='customer', channel='verified_call', verified=True]
- event 3 (H&V secure profile-change process): I have started the approved phone-number change process following the verified call. I have not changed the profile number or bypassed the old-device check; the customer must confirm the change securely. [facts: access_asked=True]
- event 1 (Elowen Mercer): I need to change the phone number on my profile because I no longer have access to my old phone. Please tell me the approved way to confirm a replacement; this email is a request, not my authorisation to make the change. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=True]

## Escalated

No.

## What failed

- nothing

Requests the policy refused:

- `redirect_secure`: redirect-to-the-secure-process: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING); request_type = access is false (request_type=change)

## Final result

wait (WAITING)
