# Case banking-029-at-02: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-029-at-02:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): I’m following up because I need to know whether this tablet is linked before I try to use it for banking. Could you check its current status? [facts: requester='Mara Ellison', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellison", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Mara Ellison (by `read-requester`).

51. The agent asked for `ask_system` {"system": "access"}.
52.

53. State `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING` (by `access-ask`).
54. Rule `do-ask` fired: state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING).
55. Called `ask_system` (attempt 1, key banking-029-at-02:do-ask:15).
56. Action in the world: `ask_system` {"system": "access", "about": "access"}.
57. `ask_system` found {}.
58. State `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED` (by `do-ask`).
59. The case closed in `ASKED`: **ask_system**.
