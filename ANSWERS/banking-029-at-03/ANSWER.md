# Case banking-029-at-03: Is the new device linked?

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, who is not verified and wrote over secure chat, asked whether her new tablet is linked before she tries to use it for banking. The desk classified it as an access question, asked the access system, and closed the case in WAITING because that system's answer had not come back. The agent's later attempts to ask the system again, redirect to the secure process, and escalate were all refused because the case was already in WAITING, so no device status has been given to her and a person still needs to check it once the access answer arrives.

## Actions taken

- none

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `WAITING`: rule `access-waits` — The system was asked; its answer is not in yet.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - next_system = access → true (next_system=access)
  - access_asked → true (access_asked=True)
  - access_status absent → true (access_status=not known)

Facts established:

- requester: **Mara Ellison**
- role: **customer**
- channel: **secure_chat**
- verified: **False**
- subject: **access**
- access_asked: **True**
- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **False**
- request_type: **question**
- next_system: **access**

- event 3 (Access log): I’m checking the device-linking state for Mara Ellison’s new tablet under case HV-029. Please return the recorded status only. [facts: access_asked=True]
