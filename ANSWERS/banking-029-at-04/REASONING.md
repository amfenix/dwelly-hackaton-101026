## What the agent said

> I sent the reply to Mara Ellison. The access records show the tablet registration as awaiting confirmation. It is not yet linked, and there is no confirmation on file. The reply is written to say only that.
> 
> The customer is not verified on this chat. I did not add any account-specific detail beyond that status.
