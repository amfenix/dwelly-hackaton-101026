# Case banking-031-at-02: June statement in the secure portal

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Elowen Marr, writing over secure chat, said she still can't find her June statement in the portal and asked for it to be made available there rather than sent by email. The desk classified this as a question about a statement and asked the documents system about it, and the case closed at that step. The documents system returned nothing, so it is not known whether the statement exists or can be shown in the portal, and Elowen Marr is still recorded as not verified; any follow-up on getting the statement into the portal is left for a person.

  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = documents → true (args.system=documents)
  - next_system = documents → true (next_system=documents)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=documents)
  - documents_asked absent → true (documents_asked=not known)
  - document_ready = false → not known (document_ready=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
