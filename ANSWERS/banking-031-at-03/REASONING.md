# Case banking-031-at-03: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-031-at-03:read-requester:1).

64. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Customer Elowen Marr (unverified, secure chat) says she owns the account and cannot find her June 2025 statement in the secure portal; she wants it made available there, not emailed. The documents system was already asked, but it returned no result: document_ready is unknown. A repeat query was refused. Please check whether the June 2025 statement exists and is published to the portal, verify the customer's identity, and reply to her."}.
65. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).

## What the agent said

> The case is still waiting and I couldn't move it forward, so it will be handed to a person.
> 
> - **Documents check:** The documents system was already asked, but its answer isn't in the case. `document_ready` is unknown, so I can't say whether the June 2025 statement exists or has been published to the portal.
> - **Second query:** My repeat request to the documents system was refused because the case is in WAITING, not TRIAGED, and the documents query had already been made.
> - **Escalation:** My escalation to a person was refused for the same reason: the case isn't in TRIAGED.
> - **Identity:** The requester, Elowen Marr, is not verified, so nothing should be released to her yet.
> 
> I haven't told the customer anything about the statement.
