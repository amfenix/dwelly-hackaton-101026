# Case banking-033-at-02: Transactions export

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison asked, through secure chat, to be told when her CSV export of transactions from 6 to 9 May 2025 is available in her secure portal, since she wasn't sure how to tell whether it had been created. The desk classified this as a question about a document and sent an inquiry to the documents system, which returned nothing, so the case closed with no answer on whether the file exists. Her identity is still unverified, and nothing in the record shows who will tell her when the file is ready.

## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: documents, about: document), by rule `do-ask`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `documents-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = documents → true (args.system=documents)
  - next_system = documents → true (next_system=documents)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=documents)
  - documents_asked absent → true (documents_asked=not known)
  - document_ready = false → not known (document_ready=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
