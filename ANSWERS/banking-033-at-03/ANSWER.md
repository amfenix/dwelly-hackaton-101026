# Case banking-033-at-03: Transactions export

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, writing over secure chat, asked for a CSV export of her transactions from 6 to 9 May 2025 and wanted to know when it would be in her secure portal. The desk asked the documents system, which has not yet said whether the file exists, so the case closed as "wait" and the desk's attempted reply to her was refused. Mara has not been told whether the file is ready, and the record shows no action taken beyond the documents request; the agent's note says a person will pick it up.
