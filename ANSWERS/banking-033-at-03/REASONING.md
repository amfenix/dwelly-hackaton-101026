## What the agent said

> I haven't replied to Mara, and the case is now waiting. The desk refused the reply because the documents system hasn't confirmed whether the CSV export for 6–9 May 2025 exists (document_ready is not known). The case is in the WAITING state, which is final, so I'm stopping here. A person will pick it up.
> 
> Mara hasn't been told whether the file is in her secure portal. Nothing in the case shows it is, and I haven't claimed otherwise.
