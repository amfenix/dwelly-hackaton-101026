# Case banking-034-at-02: Explaining a service fee

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellery, an unverified customer on secure chat, asked the desk to check which tariff entry applied to a £3.20 fee on a withdrawal and how it accounts for that amount. The desk classed it as a fee question and sent it to the tariff system, and the case closed with that query asked. The record shows no answer from the tariff system yet, so nothing has been explained to her, and the agent's draft reply mentions a "foreign-currency cash withdrawal" and a promise to reply that the record doesn't support.

  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = tariff → true (args.system=tariff)
  - next_system = tariff → true (next_system=tariff)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=tariff)
  - tariff_asked absent → true (tariff_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
