# Case banking-034-at-04: Explaining a service fee

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellery, writing over secure chat without being verified, asked the desk to escalate and check which tariff entry applied to a £3.20 fee on a withdrawal, and how it accounts for the amount. The desk classed it as a request for a record fact about a fee and sent a query about the £3.20 fee to the documents system, and the case closed with that question asked. No answer from the documents system is in the record, so the explanation of the fee is still outstanding.

## What the system received

- Source role: Bank customer
- Bank: Harrow & Vale Bank plc (fictional)
- Created: 2025-09-23 09:00:00 UTC

The request:

> I can see a £3.20 fee beside a foreign-currency cash withdrawal in my H&V secure portal, but I don't understand what the charge is for or how its amount was determined. Please check the fee against the tariff that applied to that transaction.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-09-23T09:00:00Z · Secure portal — Harrow & Vale Bank plc → Mara Ellery

> A £3.20 service fee is shown beside your foreign-currency cash withdrawal. The transaction and fee are listed in your secure portal.

2. 2025-09-23T09:47:00Z · Secure chat — Mara Ellery → H&V service agent

> I don't understand the £3.20 fee shown against this withdrawal. Please escalate this and check which tariff entry applied and how it accounts for the amount.

3. 2025-09-23T10:34:00Z · Internal note — H&V service agent → H&V transaction records

> I am starting the review by matching the recorded transaction type and processing date against the tariff in force on that date. Case HV-034; no refund or account change is authorised by this review.

4. 2025-09-23T11:21:00Z · Internal note — H&V service agent → H&V case record

> I checked the transaction record against the applicable tariff entry. The record identifies a foreign-currency cash withdrawal, and the £3.20 fee matches the entry applicable to that transaction on its processing date.

Attachments: none.

  - next_system = documents → true (next_system=documents)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=documents)
  - documents_asked absent → true (documents_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, instruction, authority] → true (request_type=record_fact)
