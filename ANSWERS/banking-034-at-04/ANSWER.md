# Case banking-034-at-04: Explaining a service fee

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## What the system received

- Source role: Bank customer
- Bank: Harrow & Vale Bank plc (fictional)
- Created: 2025-09-23 09:00:00 UTC

The request:

> I can see a £3.20 fee beside a foreign-currency cash withdrawal in my H&V secure portal, but I don't understand what the charge is for or how its amount was determined. Please check the fee against the tariff that applied to that transaction.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-09-23T09:00:00Z · Secure portal — Harrow & Vale Bank plc → Mara Ellery

> A £3.20 service fee is shown beside your foreign-currency cash withdrawal. The transaction and fee are listed in your secure portal.

2. 2025-09-23T09:47:00Z · Secure chat — Mara Ellery → H&V service agent

> I don't understand the £3.20 fee shown against this withdrawal. Please escalate this and check which tariff entry applied and how it accounts for the amount.

3. 2025-09-23T10:34:00Z · Internal note — H&V service agent → H&V transaction records

> I am starting the review by matching the recorded transaction type and processing date against the tariff in force on that date. Case HV-034; no refund or account change is authorised by this review.

4. 2025-09-23T11:21:00Z · Internal note — H&V service agent → H&V case record

> I checked the transaction record against the applicable tariff entry. The record identifies a foreign-currency cash withdrawal, and the £3.20 fee matches the entry applicable to that transaction on its processing date.

Attachments: none.

  - args.system = documents → true (args.system=documents)
  - next_system = documents → true (next_system=documents)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=documents)
  - documents_asked absent → true (documents_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
