# Case banking-035-at-02: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-035-at-02:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): After completing H&V’s identification checks, I asked you to review the £4.50 paper statement fee dated 18 June 2025.

## What the agent said

> I passed Mara's request to the team that handles fee reviews. It covers the £4.50 paper statement fee dated 18 June 2025, which she disputes because she had chosen electronic statements. The desk accepted it and the case is now in the REQUESTED state.
> 
> I haven't checked the tariff records, so I can't say yet whether the fee was applied correctly. I first tried to look at the tariff system, but the desk refused, because a review request goes straight to the review team. The outcome of the review is still to come.
