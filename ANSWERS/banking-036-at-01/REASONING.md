## What the agent said

> The case is already closed. It was redirected to the bank's secure process, and the status shows that outcome as final.
> 
> Mara Ellison isn't verified, and she sent the request by email rather than through the portal. So the bank can't change her correspondence address from this message. She needs to make the change herself through the secure process. I took no further action.
