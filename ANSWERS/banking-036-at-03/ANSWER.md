# Case banking-036-at-03: New correspondence address

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, a verified customer in the secure portal, asked to change her correspondence address. The desk put the case on hold (waiting) because the protected profile-change process is running and still needs her to confirm, and no confirmation has been received yet. No change was made to her address; the agent's two follow-up attempts, `submit_request` and `redirect_secure`, were both refused because the case was already in the waiting state. What is left is her confirmation in the profile process.

## Actions taken

- none

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `WAITING`: rule `profile-change-waits-for-the-process` — The protected change process is running; it asks the customer to confirm.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - request_type = change → true (request_type=change)
  - subject = profile → true (subject=profile)
  - access_asked → true (access_asked=True)
  - confirmation in [none, requested] → true (confirmation=none)

Facts established:

- requester: **Mara Ellison**
- role: **customer**
- channel: **secure_portal**
- verified: **True**
- subject: **profile**
- access_asked: **True**
- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **True**
- request_type: **change**
- next_system: **access**

Where they came from:

- event 3 (H&V profile change process): I have checked Mara’s identity and reviewed the workflow’s requirements. I’m opening the address-change process for case HV-036; no address is recorded in this note. [facts: access_asked=True]
- event 1 (Mara Ellison): I have moved within the UK and am writing to let you know. Please update the address you use for my correspondence; I understand this email alone does not change my profile. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=True]
