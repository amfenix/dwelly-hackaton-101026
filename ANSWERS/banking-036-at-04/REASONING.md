## What the agent said

> The case is already at its end state. The address change was sent to Mara Ellison's secure portal for her to confirm, and the outcome is recorded as `send_for_confirmation`. I'm not taking any further action.
> 
> The case facts still show `confirmation: none`. Her message confirming the change doesn't count as the profile process's own confirmation. The change only takes effect once she confirms it in the portal's profile process.
