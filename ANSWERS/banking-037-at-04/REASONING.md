# Case banking-037-at-04: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-037-at-04:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Elowen Marr): After completing H&V’s identification checks, I explained that my profile shows “Elowen Mar” but my correct name is “Elowen Marr”. Please escalate a correction request; I understand the data team may ask for supporting information. [facts: requester='Elowen Marr', role='customer', channel='verified_call', verified=True]
