## What the agent said

> I asked the documents system about Mara Ellison's request for a document confirming her account relationship, and the desk accepted the request. The case now shows as asked and final, with no refusals.
> 
> The documents system's answer has not come back into the case yet. Its answer isn't in the facts, so I can't say whether a confirmation document exists or has been made available in the portal. I have not replied to the customer or sent her anything.
