# Case banking-038-at-02: Account confirmation available in the secure portal

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, a customer on secure chat, asked for an account confirmation document to be made available in her own secure portal only. The desk classified this as a question about a document and sent a query to the documents system, then closed the case as final with nothing further done. The documents system returned no answer, Mara is still unverified, and nothing has been made available in her portal, so a person would need to follow up on the document.
