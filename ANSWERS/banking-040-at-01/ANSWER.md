# Case banking-040-at-01: Confirmation of a Specific Payment

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

The customer asked for a document showing the current stage of their £74.00 payment to a repair contractor, so they could share evidence of it. The desk classified it as a document request and sent a query to the documents system about the £74.00 payment. The case closed as asked, and the bank's record showed the payment as sent on 14 July 2025 with reference HV-040. The desk's attempt to send a reply was refused because the case was already closed, so no reply went out and nothing in the record shows the document being produced or delivered.

## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: documents, about: document, amount: 74.00), by rule `do-ask`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `documents-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = documents → true (args.system=documents)
  - next_system = documents → true (next_system=documents)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=documents)
  - documents_asked absent → true (documents_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=document)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)

Facts established:

- subject: **document**
- amount: **74.00**
- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **False**
- request_type: **document**
- next_system: **documents**

Where they came from:

- initial request (system): I need a copy of the bank record for my £74.00 payment to a repair contractor, so I can share evidence of the payment with them. I can see the transaction in my secure portal, but need a document showing its current stage. [facts: amount='74.00']
- event 1 (Harrow & Vale Bank plc): I show an outgoing payment of £74.00 dated 14 July 2025 in your transaction history. Its reference is HV-040 and its bank status is SENT. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]
