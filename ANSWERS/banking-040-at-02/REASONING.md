# Case banking-040-at-02: how the decision was reached

Every line below is a record of the run, in order: the agent's requests, the rules that fired with the facts they saw, what checks returned, and each change of state.

1. Case opened in `READING` under policy banking-desk v1.
2. Rule `read-requester` fired: state = READING → true (state=READING).
3. Called `identify_requester` (attempt 1, key banking-040-at-02:read-requester:1).
4. Note from `read-requester`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): I need a record for this particular payment to give my repair contractor. I can see HV-040 in my history, but I need a document showing its stage; I understand that the contractor’s confirmation of receipt is separate. [facts: requester='Mara Ellison', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
5. `identify_requester` found {"requester": "Mara Ellison", "role": "customer", "channel": "secure_chat", "verified": false}.
6. `requester`: not known → Mara Ellison (by `read-requester`).

13. Note from `read-subject`: event 2 (Mara Ellison): I need a record for this particular payment to give my repair contractor.
