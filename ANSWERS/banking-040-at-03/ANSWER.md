# Case banking-040-at-03: Confirmation of a Specific Payment

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, a customer on secure chat whose identity was not verified, asked for a document showing the stage of her £74.00 payment HV-040 to give to her repair contractor. The desk treated it as a document question, found the documents system had already been asked, and closed the case in a final WAITING state because no answer from that system is in yet. A second request to the documents system was refused because the case was no longer in the triaged state, no document was produced, and no reply has been sent to Mara, so a person needs to pick it up.
