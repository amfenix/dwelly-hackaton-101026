# Case banking-041-at-01: Payroll file receipt confirmation

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison, a verified authorised file uploader, asked the desk to confirm whether batch-041.csv (reference HV-041, with a £420.00 line) had been received. The desk classed it as a status request and asked the payment system about the batch. That system's answer is not in the record, and the case closed in the "asked" state. The desk refused the agent's attempt to send a reply because no payment status was recorded, so Mara has not been told whether the file was received, and that reply is still outstanding.

## Actions taken

- `ask_system` (system: payment, about: batch, reference: HV-041, amount: 420.00), by rule `do-ask`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `ASK_PENDING`: the agent asked for `ask_system`, rule `payment-ask` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = payment → true (args.system=payment)
  - next_system = payment → true (next_system=payment)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=payment)
  - payment_asked absent → true (payment_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=status)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
