## What the agent said

> I asked the payment system about batch-041.csv (reference HV-041), and the desk accepted the request. The case is now closed at that step.
> 
> No receipt status has come back yet. The case facts still show no confirmation for the batch, so I can't yet tell Mara Ellison whether the file was received. The requester is also still marked as not verified.
> 
> I have not approved, released or changed anything on the payroll.
