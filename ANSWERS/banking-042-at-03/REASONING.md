## What the agent said

> I've stopped here without taking any further action on this case. It is already in a waiting state, which is final. The business system has already been asked about batch HV-042, and nothing more is due from the desk.
> 
> I tried to send Nadia Fenwick to the secure sign-in process. The desk refused, because the case is waiting and the request counts as a question rather than an access problem. The case record has no answer from the business system yet, so there is nothing to report back to her. She is also unverified and has the viewer role, so I haven't released any report details in chat.
> 
> The case stays open for a person to pick up.
