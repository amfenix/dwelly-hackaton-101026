## What the agent said

> I've already asked the business system about batch HV-042. The case is waiting on its answer, so I'm taking no further step now.
> 
> The facts also show that Nadia Fenwick is not verified and has a viewer role. Once the business system answers, we can see what the record says about her access to the row-level error report.
