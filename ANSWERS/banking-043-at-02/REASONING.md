## What the agent said

> I've asked the payment system about the status of the payroll package. The case is now closed on that step. The system's answer hasn't come back into the case yet, so I can't tell Mara whether the package is waiting for her co-signer or has moved on.
> 
> The case shows Mara as not verified. I haven't told her anything about the package.
