## What the agent said

> The case is waiting, and I can't do anything more with it at the moment.
> 
> The business system has already been asked about Northmere Studio Ltd's payroll payment package, and a second request was refused. The case is closed in a waiting state, and no package status has come back. So I can't tell you whether the package is waiting for your co-signer or has moved on. I also can't confirm whether the second signatory still needs to act. Your session is not verified either, which would limit what I could share.
> 
> I haven't submitted, forwarded or changed anything on the package. When the business system's answer arrives, the case can be answered from that.
