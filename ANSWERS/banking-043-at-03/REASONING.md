## What the agent said

> I haven't been able to tell Mara whether the payroll package is waiting for her co-signer or has moved on. My attempt to reply was refused.
> 
> The business system was already asked about this case, but its answer hasn't come back. The case has no package status recorded, so there is nothing yet to base a reply on. The case is now in a waiting state and is closed with the outcome "wait". Mara's identity also isn't verified on this chat.
> 
> No further action is possible until the business system's answer is in the case.
