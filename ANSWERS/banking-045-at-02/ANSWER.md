# Case banking-045-at-02: New employee access request

**Decision: forward_to_authority**  (final state `FORWARDED`)

## What the system received

- Source role: Authorised business user
- Bank: Harrow & Vale Bank plc (fictional)
- Created: 2025-10-15 09:00:00 UTC

The request:

> Nadia asked H&V to arrange secure-portal access for a new colleague so they could help with the company’s payment administration. Nadia does not have authority to assign user roles, and the company administrator’s approval was still required.

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-10-15T09:00:00Z · External message — Nadia Bell → Harrow & Vale Bank business support

> I work in finance operations at Merefield Design Studio Ltd. Please arrange secure-portal access for our new colleague, who will help with payment administration. I’m not the company administrator, so I can’t approve or assign their role.

2. 2025-10-15T09:47:00Z · Secure chat — Nadia Bell → H&V business support agent

> I’m following up to find out the next step for the access request. I still need the company administrator to approve it.

Attachments: none.

## Actions taken

- `forward_to_authority` (to: the verified company administrator, about: role, requester: Nadia Bell), by rule `do-forward`

## Decision and why

How the case moved:

- `READING` → `TRIAGED`: rule `triage`.
  - state = READING → true (state=READING)
- `TRIAGED` → `FORWARD_PENDING`: the agent asked for `forward_to_authority`, rule `forward-to-the-authority` accepted it.
  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - request_type = authority → true (request_type=authority)
  - role != business_admin → true (role=customer)
- `FORWARD_PENDING` → `FORWARDED`: rule `do-forward`.
  - state = FORWARD_PENDING → true (state=FORWARD_PENDING)

Facts established:

- requester: **Nadia Bell**
- role: **customer**
- channel: **secure_chat**
- verified: **False**
- subject: **role**
- confirmation: **none**
- instructed_outside_portal: **False**
- request_type: **authority**
- next_system: **business**

- event 2 (Nadia Bell): I’m following up to find out the next step for the access request. I still need the company administrator to approve it. [facts: requester='Nadia Bell', role='customer', channel='secure_chat', verified=False]
- event 2 (Nadia Bell): I’m following up to find out the next step for the access request. I still need the company administrator to approve it. [facts: confirmation='none', instructed_outside_portal=False]
