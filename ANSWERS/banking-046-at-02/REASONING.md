## What the agent said

> I submitted the request to revoke Owen Bell's Payroll Approver role for Larkmere Studio Ltd. The desk accepted it, and the case is now in the REQUESTED state.
> 
> Mara Ellery gave the instruction on a verified call, and the desk confirmed her identity and administrator mandate. The instruction was clear, so I didn't check the business system first. I haven't confirmed that the role has actually been removed.
> 
> The review of operations Owen Bell authorised earlier was not part of this request, and I haven't started it.
