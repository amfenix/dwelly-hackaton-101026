## What the agent said

> Facts point to the business system for company limits. I'll ask it.
> I've asked the business system for the current outgoing-payment limit on Maeve's company profile. The case is now marked as asked, and the answer hasn't come back yet. When it does, the reply to Maeve should report that limit as the system gives it. Maeve's request is a question only, and nothing has been submitted or changed.
