# Case banking-047-at-02: Company Payment Limit

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Maeve Calder, a viewer whose identity was not verified, asked over secure chat for the company's current payment limit. The desk classified it as a question about the limit and asked the business system for that information, and the case closed in the asked state. No answer has been given to Maeve; the record does not show the business system's reply, and her identity is still unverified, so whether she may be told the limit remains to be checked by a person.

  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = business → true (args.system=business)
  - next_system = business → true (next_system=business)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=business)
  - business_asked absent → true (business_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
