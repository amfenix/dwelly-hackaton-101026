# Case banking-047-at-03: Company Payment Limit

**Decision: wait**  (final state `WAITING`)

## Summary

Maeve Calder, an unverified viewer writing over secure chat, asked the desk to confirm the company's current payment limit. The desk queried the business system, but its answer had not come in, so the case closed in WAITING with no limit given and no actions taken. The agent's later attempts to ask the system again, reply, and escalate to a person were all refused because the case was no longer in the right state, so nobody has yet verified her identity and authority or confirmed the limit to her.
