64. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Maeve Calder (viewer role, secure chat, identity not verified) asks for the current outgoing-payment limit on the company profile. The business system has already been queried, but no limit value is in the case. Further business asks are refused because the case is in WAITING. Nothing has been disclosed. Please verify the requester and provide the limit if she is entitled to see it. She has not submitted the planned supplier payout."}.
65. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).

## What the agent said

> I couldn't move this case forward, and it is still waiting. Nothing has been disclosed to Maeve.
> 
> - **No limit in the case:** The business system has already been queried, but its answer contains no limit value, so there is nothing I can report to Maeve.
> - **Further actions refused:** The case is in a waiting state. Asking the business system again was refused, and so was escalating to a person.
> - **Verification:** Maeve is a viewer and has not been verified in secure chat. That would need resolving before any limit is shared.
> 
> The case now stays open for a person to pick up. They would need to verify her and confirm the company payment limit. She has not submitted the planned supplier payout.
