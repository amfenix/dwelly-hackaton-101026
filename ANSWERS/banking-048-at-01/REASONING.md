## What the agent said

> I've asked the incoming-payments system whether the buyer's payment has reached the H&V business account. The system accepted the request, but its answer isn't in the case yet. The case record still shows no confirmation of the payment, so I can't say whether it has arrived. The next step is to reply to the customer once that answer comes in.
