# Case banking-048-at-02: The buyer said payment was sent

**Decision: ask_system**  (final state `ASKED`)

## Summary

Mara Ellison of Alder Quay Studio Ltd. asked over secure chat whether an identifiable credit for a workshop invoice payment has reached the company's account. The desk treated it as a status question about an incoming payment and sent the query to the incoming-payments system, which accepted it but has returned no answer yet. A reply to her was refused because no result is in the case, so she has not been told anything, and she remains unverified, so a person still needs to follow up once the system answers and her identity is confirmed.
