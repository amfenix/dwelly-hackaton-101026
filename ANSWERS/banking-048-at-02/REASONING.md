## What the agent said

> I've asked the incoming-payments system whether the buyer's payment has reached the account. The request was accepted, and the case is now closed at that step. No result from the incoming records is in the case yet, so I can't say whether a matching credit has arrived.
> 
> Mara Ellison's identity is also still marked as not verified.
