## What the agent said

> I asked the incoming-payments system whether a credit has arrived. The desk accepted the request, so that was the next step. A reply to the customer isn't possible yet because the system hasn't returned an answer. When I tried to reply, the desk refused because `incoming_found` isn't in the case. I'm stopping here, as the task allows one step.
> 
> The requester, Mara Ellison, is still marked as not verified. Any reply should not give out account details until she is verified.
