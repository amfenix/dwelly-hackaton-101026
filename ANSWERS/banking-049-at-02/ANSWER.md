The request:

What happened up to now:

1. 2025-10-23T09:00:00Z · Business portal — Mara Venn → H&V business portal

> I selected 1–7 July 2025 for North Quay Printworks’ acquiring report. I need the file to review the card sales and adjustments.

2. 2025-10-23T09:47:00Z · Secure chat — Mara Venn → H&V service agent

> I’m the authorised manager for the shop. The report for the period I selected is not showing as available, so I’m asking you to escalate the file request.

  - state = TRIAGED → true (state=TRIAGED)
  - args.system = documents → true (args.system=documents)
  - next_system = documents → true (next_system=documents)
  - next_system absent → false (next_system=documents)
  - documents_asked absent → true (documents_asked=not known)
  - request_type not in [register, change, authority] → true (request_type=question)
- `ASK_PENDING` → `ASKED`: rule `do-ask`.
  - state = ASK_PENDING → true (state=ASK_PENDING)
