66. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Mara Venn (unverified, secure chat) says she is the authorised manager for North Quay Printworks. She requests the acquiring report for 1–7 July 2025 (card sales and adjustments). The portal shows it as not available. The documents system has already been asked, but document_ready is not known and a second documents query was refused. Her identity and authority are not verified. A person needs to verify her, then check whether the report exists or can be generated."}.
67. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).

## What the agent said

> I couldn't move this case forward, and it stays open in the WAITING state for a person to pick up.
> 
> - **Documents check:** The documents system had already been asked, but the case holds no answer on whether the 1–7 July 2025 acquiring report is ready. A second documents query was refused because the case is in WAITING, not TRIAGED.
> - **Escalation:** My escalation was refused for the same reason. So the customer's escalation request has not been passed on yet.
> - **Customer:** Mara Venn is not verified. She says she is the authorised manager for North Quay Printworks, but the bank has not confirmed that.
> 
> A person will need to verify her and her authority. They will also need to check whether the report exists or can be generated.
