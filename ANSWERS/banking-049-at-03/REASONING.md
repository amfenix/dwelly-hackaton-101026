## What the agent said

> The case is still open and waiting. Both of my attempts were refused, so nothing has moved on Mara Venn's request for the 1–7 July 2025 acquiring report.
> 
> - **Documents check:** the desk had already queried the documents system for this case, and no answer is recorded. A second query was refused because the case is in WAITING, not TRIAGED.
> - **Escalation:** I tried to hand it to a person with a note, but that was also refused for the same reason, because the case is not TRIAGED.
> 
> The requester is also still unverified. She says she is the authorised manager, but the desk has not confirmed that. Nothing has been released, and I'm making no further attempts. The case stays open for a person to pick up.
