The case is in WAITING and further document queries are refused. Please verify the requester's identity and authority, then check why the report is unavailable."}.

## What the agent said

> I couldn't move this case forward, and it is still in WAITING.
> 
> - **Documents system:** the desk had already queried it, so a second query was refused. No answer about the acquiring report for 1–7 July 2025 is recorded in the case.
> - **Escalation:** this was refused too, because escalation only works from the TRIAGED state and the case is in WAITING.
> - **Customer:** Mara Venn is still unverified, so I can't confirm she is the authorised manager for North Quay Printworks.
> 
> The case is closed on "wait" and stays open for a person to pick up. That person will need to verify Mara Venn's identity and authority, and find out why the report isn't showing as available.
