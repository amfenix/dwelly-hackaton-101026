70. The agent asked for `escalate` {"note": "Mara Venn (unverified, secure chat) says she is the authorised manager for North Quay Printworks. She asks for the acquiring report for 1–7 July 2025 (card sales and adjustments). The portal shows the report as not available. The documents system has already been asked, but the case has no readiness result (document_ready is not known). The desk cannot ask again. Please check why the report is unavailable, and verify her identity and authority before releasing any file."}.
71. Refused `escalate` in `WAITING`: agent-escalates: state = TRIAGED is false (state=WAITING).

## What the agent said

> I couldn't move this case forward. Both of my attempts were refused, and the case is closed in a waiting state.
> 
> - **Documents check:** I tried to ask the documents system about the acquiring report for 1–7 July 2025. The desk refused because the case is no longer open for new checks. The documents system had already been asked once, but the case holds no result saying whether the report is ready.
> - **Escalation:** I then tried to escalate to a person, as Mara Venn asked. The desk refused that as well, because escalation is only allowed while the case is open.
> 
> Nothing has been sent or released. Mara Venn is also not verified, so her claim to be the shop's authorised manager has not been confirmed. The case needs to be reopened, or picked up by a person, to find out why the report isn't showing as available.
