## What the agent said

> The facts show the next system is payment, and its answer isn't in the case yet. I'll ask it.
> I asked the payment system about this transfer. It hasn't returned an answer yet, so I can't say which stage the payment has reached. The case is still open and marked final, which means it goes to a person to pick up.
> 
> Right now the records show only that the payment authorisation was recorded in the business portal for the Alder Quay Supplies materials invoice. I tried to reply to the customer, but the desk refused because no payment status is on the case. I can't tell the customer where the payment is until that status comes back.
